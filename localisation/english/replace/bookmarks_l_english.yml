 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Dawn of the 18th century"
 EMPIRE_DAWN_OF_THE_EIGHTEENTH_CENTURY_DESC:0 "The year is 1699 and Europe is ravaged by war. It has been two years since the establishment of peace between France and the Grand Alliance after the war of the league of Augsburg (1688–1697). This peace is however believed to be a mere truce, as Europe once again prepares for a major conflict now that the heirless king of Spain Carlos II’s health is ailing, and a diplomatic solution to his succession seems unlikely.\nIn the meantime, in the Balkans the Ottoman empire has signed an armistice with the Holy Alliance concluding the disastrous Ottoman campaign of 1683. At the same time the war between the Russians and Ottomans has more or less come to an end as Russia is gearing up to face another enemy: Sweden.The ascension of a young and inexperienced king in Sweden, Charles XII, has led to the formation of an anti-Swedish alliance that seeks to gain an advantage of Sweden’s weakness. Even though Europe desperately desires peace, it is looking likely that all of Europe will once again be in flames…"
 
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Glorious Revolution in 1688, England has seen large economic growth thanks to a personal union with the Dutch, even though the revolution left deep scars. England is in a strong diplomatic position, finding many allies who wish to counter the Bourbon menace. Political uncertainty in Spain threatens to disturb the balance of power in Europe, as France once more seeks to expand. England must stand ready and intervene if necessary, for the balance of power cannot be disturbed!"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Under the leadership of Louis XIV, ‘the Sun King’, France has firmly established itself as the dominant power in Europe. To keep France in check, the other European powers formed a ‘Grand Alliance’ to counter France. With the Habsburg line threatening to end in Spain, the time is ripe for the next change of Louis’ plan to dominate Europe. A puppet king in Spain, surely would make France unstoppable."
 NETHERLANDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Dutch Republic’s independence from the Spanish they have been a dominant economic power in Europe. As a haven of tolerance, the Netherlands have attracted thinkers and artists from all over Europe, starting the Dutch Golden Era. In 1688 finally came an end to the Anglo-Dutch rivalry after the establishment of a personal union under William of Orange. The French threat however has put a strain on the budget, and the military expenses are far greater than the income. Will the Republic continue to the decline, or will a second Golden Era save the nation?"
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The still ongoing war with the Ottoman empire, has firmly established Austria as the dominant power in central Europe. Now that Hungary has returned to the empire, it is time to seek peace so that Austria can focus on the upcoming crisis in Western Europe, for the balance of power is at stake. Although a Habsburg candidate is in place to succeed the Spanish king, the Bourbons seek to establish a candidate of their own. Will you solve this crisis through diplomacy, or shall you go to war?"
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the 30 years war, Sweden has know a golden era and exceptional rulers. They managed to field an impressive army and built a dominant empire in Northern Europe, encompassing most of the Baltic. On this path to greatness however, they have made many enemies. Now that a young and unexperienced king, Charles XII, sits upon the throne, the enemies of Sweden sense weakness. Russians to the east, Danes to the west and Poles to the south. Preparations must be made, for war is coming."
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Tsardom of Russia is increasingly lagging behind Europe in practically everything. Fortunately, Pyotr Alekseyevich, the new Tsar of Russia, is looking foward to implementing radical reforms with the aim of modernizing Russia, and has already begun preparing for an inevitable war with Sweden which will determine the fate of Russia itself and if successful, will establish itself as the greatest empire in Eastern Europe. Unfortunately, internal opposition against these reforms and the archaic and corrupt bureaucracy must be dealt with force and hopefully, little bloodshed."
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Spanish Empire was the dominant power in Europe up to the 17th century when hyperinflation and constant wars with France caused a steep decline. Entering the 18th century, the empire is in crisis. Bankruptcy has grinded to economy to a standstill, and the faltering health of the heirless Habsburg king threatens to spark a succession crisis which will bring war to Europe once more."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania has been in a state of near constant warfare for decades. Its population has been devasted by war, weakening the commonwealth’s position. Poland sits at a precarious geographic position, occupying a largely flat plain between the Habsburg empire, Russia, and the rising power Prussia. A newly elected king, Augustus Frederick, now seeks to reform the elective monarchy to put an end to the meddling of foreign power and to restore Poland-Lithuania’s former greatness. He is however expected to experience great resistance by has many rivals."
 PRS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Prince-electorate of Brandenburg Prussia is seen as a rising regional power. Since the inheritance of Prussia in 1618 the Margraviate of Brandenburg has managed to expand its boundaries through cunning diplomacy and an effective military force. The upcoming conflicts in Europe are a test for Brandenburg-Prussia: Will they make a difference, and firmly establish themselves as a major European power."
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the Great Turkish war between the Ottomans and Austrians draws to a close, the Ottomans are left defeated. Decades of weak leadership and a disastrous military campaign have left the Ottoman empire on the verge of collapse. On top of that, the increasingly powerfull janissaries are on the brink of revolting. Will you restore the Ottoman greatness, or will you be the last Khalifa?"
 SAV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The great nation of Savoy is regarded as a minor power by the major powers of Europe. However its strategic position in Northern Italy is viewed as vital by both the French and the Austrians. As the Savoyards have managed to keep good relations with the great powers, they can play both. However, Vittorio Amedeo should be careful, as becoming to ambitious might spell Savoy's downfall."
 SAX_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kurfürstentum Sachsen is a Duchy under Polish control.\nSince Frederick Augustus(King of Saxony) became King of Poland-Lithuania in 1697, Saxony has Developed into a §YGolden Century§! is known throughout the HRE for beeing a very high developed.Diplomatically it isn't that easy for them as a vassal of Poland but could change since a War is on the Horizon."
 PER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Sultan Huseyn/Hussein came to power, the presence of the Shah in the government is not felt, as Sultan Huseyn has shown in these years that he is indifferent to the affairs of the country and always entrusts his work to the clergy and courtiers. \n\nSome believe that this indifference of the Shah will be the beginning of the fall of the Safavid government, or it will cause the clergymen to become all-powerful, and this is a terrible news for all religions that are opposed to Shiites." 
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan has been in isolation ever since the Sakoku Edict, which has effectively stopped the influence of foreign nations. However, cracks have been showing in the absolute power of the Shogunate. Rebellions, dissent from Daimyos, natural disasters, and a lingering presence of foreign powers plagues Japan to this day. The government has choices to make - either they place their faith in isolation, or they open up to the world and conquer it for the Emperor and for Japan. Anything is possible."

 WAR_OF_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE_DESC:0 "It has been five years since the treaty of Utrecht brought an end to the war of the Spanish Succession. In the treaty, it was agreed that Philip V could remain king of Spain, but a clause has prevented Spain and France from ever merging. Philip also had to cede large parts of Spain’s European possessions to Austria, except for Spain itself. In the years that followed the treaty, Louis XIV has passed away, and France has now entered an alliance with England, Austria and the Netherlands called the ‘Quadruple Alliance’, aimed at containing a revanchist Spain. Spain has since reconquered Sardinia from the Austrians, and has now landed an army in Sicily making war look inevitable. \n \nIn the meantime, the Northern War is reaching its conclusion as Sweden struggles for survival against Russia and Poland-Lithuania, but also Denmark-Norway who re-entered the war after the crushing Swedish defeat near Poltava, and also the Prussians have smelt blood. Can the Swedish empire still be saved? And does Spain stand a chance against its much more powerful foes? Only time will tell."

 SPR_WAR_OF_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE_DESC:0 "Spain has lost much in the treaty of Utrecht of 1713. Philip V managed to hold on to the Spanish throne, but saw his Italian possessions and the Southern Netherlands lost to the Austrians. Now he has sought to reclaim these territories once again. In August 1717 he managed to reclaim Sardinia from the Austrians without resistance. This emboldened him to land an army in Sicily in July 1718, but to his suprise, a large coalition of Savoy, France, Britain and Austria has now moved against him. Can Spain survive this ordeal?"
 FRA_WAR_OF_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE_DESC:0 "After having lost the war of the Spanish Succession, France has had to accept the newly defined balance of power. In 1715 France lost its greatest king yet, Louis XIV, who was succeeded by his great-grandson Louis XV. In 1716, France joined an alliance with England, which was soon joined by Holland and Austria, marking the Quadruple Alliance. The main purpose of this alliance is the enforcement of the treaty of Utrecht, which is being desacrated by Spain. Now France stands on the eve of an intervention against Spain."
 ENG_WAR_OF_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE_DESC:0 "After the war of the Spanish Succession Britain has emerged as the dominant maritime and commercial power of Europe. The treaty of Utrecht of 1713 was mostly propelled by British diplomats, designing a new concept in European politics called 'Balance of Power'. This has lead to less stressed relations with the other European powers such as France, which in 1714 accepted the protestant Hanoverian Succession in Britain. However, the carefully constructed balance of power is under threat by a revanchist Spain. Britain has assembled a large coalition to tackle the rising Spanish threat, but the outcome is not yet certain..."
 AUS_WAR_OF_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE_DESC:0 "Karl VI has gained a lot from Austria's participation in the war of the Spanish Succession. Originally, he had been destined to become the king of Spain, but due to a series of circumstances he had become archduke of Austria and Holy Roman Emperor. As part of this Spanish claims, Austria had received the Low Countries, Milan, Naples and Sardinia. The latter however, was recently conquered by the Spanish whilst Austria was caught in yet another war against the Ottomans which ended in a victory, altough Austria's ally Venice had lost he Peloponese. Now Austria can once again point its attention to its Italian possessions and deal with the ever emerging Spanish threat."
 SWE_WAR_OF_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE_DESC:0 "After suffering a devastating defeat in the battle of Poltava in 1709, Charles XII had lost most of his army. His invasion of Russia was a failure, and his puppet regime in Poland quickly collapsed. Smelling opportunity, the Danes quickly declared war again on Sweden, and not much later the Prussians also joined the coalition to seize Swedish Pommeria. Now the Russian troops are pushing deep into Finland, as Charles gathers a final force to attempt to capture Norway of the Danish, but the situation is looking dire, and there is not much hope."
 RUS_WAR_OF_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE_DESC:0 "Peter the Great has firmly established Russia as a great power in Europe. Before, Russia had long been a peripherical power, but with the founding of a new westward capital and a modern and reformed state apparatus Russia has become more and more western oriented. Peter is now in the final stages of finishing of his archenemy Sweden, putting an end to the long struggle for dominance in the Baltics."
 PRS_WAR_OF_THE_QUADRUPLE_ALLIANCE_DESC:0 "Prussia is one of the fastest growing powers in Europe. As a compensation for its support to the Habsburg side in the war of the Spanish Succession, Prussia had been allowed to proclaim itself a kingdom (although offically the king in Prussia remained a mere duke in Brandenburg). Frederick I had laid the foundations for a great state, and now Frederick William I, the so-called soldier king, is continuing efforts to make Prussia a leading military power. First however, Prussia is having to wrap up a war against Sweden which it joined in 1713."

 WAR_OF_THE_POLISH_SUCCESSION_DESC:0 "Since the creation of the Anglo-French alliance in 1716, Europe has known relative peace after the defeat of Spain in the War of The Quadruple Alliance. Since 1729 however, France has been undertaking efforts to once again align itself with Spain, whilst Britain and Austria have once again fallen in each others arms. The outbreak of yet another war was considered almost unavoidable, and the death of Poland-Lithuania’s king was the last straw. Stanisław I Leszczyński, who had previously been an ally to Sweden in the Great Northern War, has now claimed the throne for himself with the support of France that has hoped to secure Lorraine, Spain that has its eyes on Southern Italy, and Sardinia eying the Austrian possessions Milan and Mantua. On the other side is Augustus III, son of the late August The Strong, supported by Russia, Austria and Prussia. Now these powers are about to clash, as Poland-Lithuania erupts in civil war."

 EMPIRE_USA_REVOLUTION_DESC:0 "Trouble in the American colonies. Following the Seven Years’ War, Britain was near bankruptcy after fighting a war to protect its colonies. Even though Britain and Spain have now acquired most of North America, booting out the French, their economies are devasted. Seeing no alternatives, Britain has decided to crack down on its colonies autonomy and has started collecting taxes overseas, including the Stamp Act. These taxes have been met with a lot of resistance in the Thirteen Colonies, cumulating in the Boston massacre of 1770. Tensions in the America have only risen since, and the banking crisis of 1773 and the implementation of the Tea Act have only made things worse. Now on this day, December 16th 1773, a rebel group known as the ‘Son's of Liberty’ dressed up like Indians, has destroyed a large amount of tea as a protest against the Tea Act. Its only a question of time, before the colony will be in open rebellion."
