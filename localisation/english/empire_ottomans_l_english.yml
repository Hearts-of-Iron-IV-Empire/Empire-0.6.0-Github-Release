The Ottomans had been defeated at Vienna in 1683 and the following years were disastrous for the Turks. The war has been devastating, the losses have been great. It must be agreed upon that the terms proposed by the Holy League were reasonable. Will peace finally return to the Europe?"

While we are definitely no friends of the Russians, it is without a doubt that breaking the established truce between ourselves and the Russians may have severe repercussions, not to mention the potential loss of life. On the other hand, if Russia would defeat its northern rival, they will be able to divert all their power to the southern front, threatening our highly disputed possessions in the Crimea. Nothing is without risk, and it is up to the Sultan to decide the course of action."
