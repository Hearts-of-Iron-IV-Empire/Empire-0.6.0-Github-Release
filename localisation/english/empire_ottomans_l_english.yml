 # Events:
 ottomans.1.t:0 "Treaty of Karlowitz"
 ottomans.1.d:0 "On 26 January 1699, the treaty of Karlowitz was signed after two months of negotiations between the Ottoman Empire and the Holy League, thus concluding the Great Turkish war of 1683-1697. The Ottomans had been defeated at Vienna in 1683 and the following years were disastrous for the Turks. The war has been devastating, the losses have been great. It must be agreed upon that the terms proposed by the Holy League were reasonable. Will peace finally return to the Europe?"
 ottomans.1.a:0 "We can only accept these terms..."
 ottomans.1.b:0 "No! These demands are unacceptable! We would rather die fighting!"
 ottomans.2.t:0 "Sweden Requests Intervention against Russia"
 ottomans.2.d:0 "Seeing the tide of war turn against them, the Swedes have approached us with the urgent request to stage an intervention against Russia, preventing them from destroying Sweden. While we are definitely no friends of the Russians, it is without a doubt that breaking the established truce between ourselves and the Russians may have severe repercussions, not to mention the potential loss of life. On the other hand, if Russia would defeat its northern rival, they will be able to divert all their power to the southern front, threatening our highly disputed possessions in the Crimea. Nothing is without risk, and it is up to the Sultan to decide the course of action."
 ottomans.3.t:0 "Ottomans pledge their support"
 ottomans.3.d:0 "The Ottomans have pledged their support to our cause against the Russians and have promised to intervene against them as soon as all armies are in place. Those Russians won't know what hit ‘em!"
 ottomans.4.t:0 "Ottomans request more time"
 ottomans.4.d:0 "The Ottomans have requested more time to intervene in our war with the Russians. They claim their armed forces and political climate are in no shape whatsoever to engage in a full-blown war. They will however move against the Russians as soon as the political climate allows it."
 ottomans.5.t:0 "Ottomans not interested in a new war"
 ottomans.5.d:0 "Disappointingly, we have received the news that the Ottomans will not be engaging in a war with Russia any time soon. Sad news indeed. However, we should not despair, as peace between the Ottomans and Russia seldom lasts."
 ottomans.10.t:0 "Edirne Event"
 ottomans.10.d:0 "The Janissaries have revolted against their Sultan following months of unrest and dissent among their ranks. They have now installed a new Sultan in Edirne, hoping to overthrow the government in Constantinople."
 ottomans.10.a:0 "Long live Ahmed III! §Y(Stand with the revolt)§!"
 ottomans.10.b:0 "It is but a minor insurrection. §Y(Stand with Mustafa)§!"
 ottomans.11.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire demands the return of Morea!"
 ottomans.11.d:0 "After achieving victory in the Great Turkish War, we have acquired the Greek territory of Morea, formerly a province of the Ottoman Empire. Now it would seem that the Ottomans want to revise the treaty, and have demanded the immediate return of Morea. How shall we respond to these outrageous demands?"
 ottomans.11.a:0 "We won't cede our territory!"
 ottomans.11.b:0 "We are no match for the Ottoman war machine."
 ottomans.12.t:0 "Venice refuses return of Morea!"

 ottomans.13.t:0 "Venice accepts our demands"
 ottomans.13.d:0 "Wisely, the Venetian ambassador brings us the news that the Venetian government has decided to agree to our demands. Justice has been delivered."
 ottomans.13.a:0 "Excellent."
 ottomans.14.t:0 "Support from the Ottoman Empire"
 ottomans.14.d:0 "As a token of support for our cause, the Ottoman Empire has sent us 2000 flintlock rifles to aid us in our battle against the Russian Empire."
 ottomans.14.a:0 "A most welcome gift!"
 ottomans.15.t:0 "Georgian Campaign"
 ottomans.15.d:0 "After gathering a significant force, the Georgian campaign was launched. As soon as the Janissaries entered Georgia, they faced fierce opposition. Many of the forces now demand an immediate withdrawal. Obviously, such a thing is not possible. The Sultan is now faced with a decision, either give the soldiers a temporary pay raise, or face the possibility of a mutiny."
 ottomans.15.a:0 "Fine, pay them extra."
 ottomans.15.b:0 "They fight for the Sultan, not for money!"
 ottomans.16.t:0 "Janissaries Left Behind"
 ottomans.16.d:0 "Following the vast land reform, the Janissaries in particular feel left behind. Not compensating them might have dire results. How shall we deal with the situation?"
 ottomans.16.a:0 "Compensate them with cash."
 ottomans.16.b:0 "Nothing, they had too much influence anyways."
 ottomans.17.t:0 "Government forces defeated!"

 ottomans.18.d:0 "The Poles and the Russians have approached us with an offer to end the war, as they themselves have decided to attack the Swedish Empire, evidently to take advantage of it's young and inexperienced king. This is great news for us, with less powers to fight we will have an easier time with the rest of the Holy League."
 ottomans.18.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 ottomans.19.t:0 "Treaty of Podolia"
 ottomans.19.d:0 "After months of negotiating, we were able to agree on a peace deal. With the Poles and the Russians dropping out of the war, it seems certain that Austrian will soon follow. Glory to the Ottoman Empire!"

 ottomans.20.a:0 "We accept."
 ottomans.20.b:0 "No! Basra is ours!"
 ottomans.21.t:0 "Persians Accept"
 ottomans.21.d:0 "The Persians have sent an envoy to our governors in the region, accepting our terms and withdrawing all forces from Basra. Now all that remains is to send an army to retake it."
 ottomans.21.a:0 "Excellent news."
 ottomans.22.t:0 "Persians Refuse!"
 ottomans.22.d:0 "The Persians have refused our generous offer, nothing more can be done on the issue..."
 ottomans.22.a:0 "What fools!"
 ottomans.23.t:0 "Basra Falls"
 ottomans.23.d:0 "After some days of marching, 30,000 troops led by the newly appointed governor of Basra, Ali Pasha, as well as the governor of Baghdad, reached Basra on the 9th of May. They demanded the surrender of the rebel garrison, who refused, and thus began the siege of the city. After a few weeks the garrison was starved out and expelled. Full control has now been re-established over Basra and the lands surrounding it."
 ottomans.23.a:0 "Welcome back to the Empire."
 ottomans.24.t:0 "Ottoman Ultimatum"
 ottomans.24.d:0 "The Ottomans have sent us an ulitimatum demanding that we pay tribute to them, and that we become their vassal. How do we respond?"
 ottomans.24.a:0 "We cannot stand against them. We agree."
 ottomans.24.b:0 "They must be insane. We decline."
 ottomans.25.t:0 "Oman Accepts!"
 ottomans.25.d:0 "Oman has accepted our ultimatum, and they are now our puppets. Their holdings will be very useful, especially in countering the Portuguese."
 ottomans.25.a:0 "Our empire grows larger."
 ottomans.26.t:0 "Oman Refuses!"
 ottomans.26.d:0 "Oman has refused our ultimatum, evidently believing that their forces are a match for ours. How do we proceed?"
 ottomans.26.a:0 "We cannot afford a war at this time..."
 ottomans.26.b:0 "Their arrogance ends today."
 ottomans.27.t:0 "Ottomans back Down"

 ottomans.28.a:0 "Damn them!" 
 ottomans.29.t:0 "Bandits destroy villages!"
 ottomans.29.d:0 "Bandits have struck multiple towns and villages in the Balkans, massacring the peasants and killing any garrisons present. This has led to even more chaos in the region. The citizens plead for government aid, and request us to help them in any way possible." 
 ottomans.29.a:0 "Scum of the earth..."
 ottomans.30.t:0 "Intervention in the Maghreb"
 ottomans.30.d:0 "With peace restored on the European front, we can now safely focus on other frontiers. A great cause of concern to the Padishah is North Africa, which has become increasingly autonomous in recent years, with Pashas being replaced by local rulers and Janissaries acting on their own, without regards to the Sultan. Currently Algeria is at war with Tunis and Morocco, we should take this opportunity to intervene and pull North Africa back into our control. How do we proceed?"
 ottomans.30.a:0 "Support Algiers."
 ottomans.30.b:0 "Support Tunis."
 ottomans.30.c:0 "They will all fall before us."
 ottomans.31.t:0 "The Fate of Persia"
 ottomans.31.d:0 "With Persia brought to its knees, we can force any sort of peace deal upon them. While the most prudent option would be to take border provinces and end the war, perhaps annihilating the threat to the east would be the best option?"
 ottomans.31.a:0 "Seize the border provinces."
 ottomans.31.b:0 "Puppet them."
 ottomans.31.c:0 "Destroy them once and for all."
