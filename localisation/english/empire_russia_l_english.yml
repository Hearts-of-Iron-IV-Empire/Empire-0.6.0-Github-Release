Zaporozhia is a rogue state, regularly plundering both our lands and our rival's. However, there has long been an agreement in place to keep the status quo to prevent the dominance of either one of the Great Powers in the Southern Ukraine.

PETER_I_DESC:0 "'By the grace of God, the most excellent and great sovereign emperor Pyotr Alekseevich the ruler of all the Russias: of Moscow, of Kiev, of Vladimir, of Novgorod, Tsar of Kazan, Tsar of Astrakhan and Tsar of Siberia, sovereign of Pskov, great prince of Smolensk, of Tver, of Yugorsk, of Perm, of Vyatka, of Bulgaria and others, sovereign and great prince of the Novgorod Lower lands, of Chernigov, of Ryazan, of Rostov, of Yaroslavl, of Belozersk, of Udora, of Kondia and the sovereign of all the northern lands, and the sovereign of the Iverian lands, of the Kartlian and Georgian Kings, of the Kabardin lands, of the Circassian and Mountain princes and many other states and lands western and eastern here and there and the successor and sovereign and ruler.'\n\nPeter I, son of tsar Alexis of house Romanov, succeeded his elder brother Feodor III alongside his brother Ivan V as co-monarch of Russia under the regency of his half-sister Sophia in 1682. By the summer of 1689, Peter, then age 17, planned to take power from his half-sister Sophia, whose position had been weakened by two unsuccessful Crimean campaigns against the Crimean Khanate in an attempt to stop devastating Crimean Tatar raids into Russia's southern lands. When she learned of his designs, Sophia conspired with some leaders of the Streltsy, who continually aroused disorder and dissent. Sophia was eventually overthrown, with Peter I and Ivan V continuing to act as co-tsars. Peter forced Sophia to enter a convent, where she gave up her name and her position as a member of the royal family.\n\nStill, Peter could not acquire actual control over Russian affairs. Power was instead exercised by his mother, Natalya Naryshkina. It was only when Natalya died in 1694 that Peter, now aged 22, became an independent sovereign. Formally, Ivan V was a co-ruler with Peter, though being ineffective. Peter became the sole ruler when Ivan died in 1696, while Peter was 24 years old.\n\nPeter has taken the first steps to implement sweeping reforms aimed at modernizing Russia. Heavily influenced by his advisors from Western Europe, Peter seeks to reorganize the Russian army among modern lines and has long dreamed of making Russia a maritime power. However, he has already faced opposition of the Streltsy, and many more groups threaten to overthrow his rule, the worst threat of them all being the Swedes in the Northwest. However, Peter has forged a plan to end the Swedish domination..."
