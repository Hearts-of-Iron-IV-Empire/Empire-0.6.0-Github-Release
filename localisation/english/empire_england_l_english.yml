england.7.d:0 "French, Dutch, English and Austrian ambassadors have come to an agreement in London concerning the succession of the Spanish throne.\n\nThe main change from the First Treaty was to replace Joseph Ferdinand with Archduke Charles heir to the Spanish throne, retaining Spain, its overseas Empire and the Spanish Netherlands. France received Naples, Sicily, and the Spanish province of Gipuzkoa as well as the Duchy of Milan, which it would exchange for the Duchy of Lorraine. France would also transfer Naples and Sicily to Victor Amadeus, Duke of Savoy in exchange for the Counties of Nice and Savoy. \n\nNow it remains to be seen whether the Spanish king will ratify this treaty, or if diplomacy totally and utterly fails."

england.11.d:0 "Our nation has initially joined France, because it was pressured by France and feared invasion. English diplomats have however made convincing arguments that the French downfall is inevitable. On top of that, the French have offered us nothing for our contribution in the war so far, making it seem a pretty pointless conflict for our country. The English have promised, that if we open another front in the east of France, we shall be rewarded the valuable possession of Sicily.

mod.13.t:0 "Fourth English Civil War"
mod.13.d:0 "For many months tension has been building up in England. It all started with the formation of the so called Second Long Parliament in opposition to William III of Orange, due to concerns over his succession and overall weak rule. As parliament made moves towards securing the state, monarchist elements took parallel measures. \n \nAn official state of civil war was officially declared after royalist troops unsuccessfully attacked the Westminster Parliament. Hostilities soon after broke out all around the country. Whilst the English are at war with one another, it is uncertain how the Irish and Scots will react to this internal strife."
mod.13.a:0 "How Awful!"
mod.14.t:0 "Restauration of Cromwell"
mod.14.d:0 "In an almost surreal fashion, Richard Cromwell, son of the late Oliver Cromwell and short-lived ruler of the English Commonwealth in 1659 before the restauration, has after more than 40 years of absence from England assumed the leadership over the Commonwealth of England. Richard Cromwell shall henceforth rule as the Lord-Protector of England with an iron fist, continuing the legacy of his father Oliver."
mod.14.a:0 "Ah the horror, here we go again!"
mod.15.t:0 "Utopia."
mod.15.d:0 "Undoubtedly, many throughout Europe would question the insane motives of the peasant craze which has taken control over England. In an almost unbelievable way, they have now proclaimed that England shall henceforth be known as Utopia. Utopia is the name of a fantasy kingdom invented by Thomas More, who wanted to expose the hypocrisy of the elements of the Ancien Régime. \n \nWhilst More had intended for his work to become mere satire, the people of England have elevated More to the rank of a prophet, and Utopia as a holy scripture. Indeed, the populace of England has gone completely mad."
mod.15.a:0 "They have clearly gone mad!"
mod.16.t:0 "Glorious Counterrevolution"
mod.16.d:0 "After an exile of more than a decade, the Old Pretender James III Stuart, son of James II, has reclaimed the throne of England and exiled William III of Orange. James was supported by the French, Scottish and Irish who would all like to see the return of a Catholic king in England. The question remains however whether the people of England have any warm feelings towards their new liege."
mod.16.a:0 "We live in a strange world..."
mod.17.t:0 "Hanoverian Succession"
mod.17.d:0 "As Queen Anne of England, Scotland and Ireland has entered in a royal marriage with duke George I of Hanover a union exists between the two states. Henceforth, England will take control over the foreign affairs of Hanover. \n \nWhilst the emperor is mostly indifferent toward the matter, the succession has mainly caused friction between England and Sweden, as the county and city of Bremen are considered rightful clay of Hanover."
mod.17.a:0 "Okay."
england.14.t:0 "Formation of the Long Parliament"
england.14.d:0 "As republican elements become more dominant in parliament, the king finds it more difficult to find a majority for his plans to centralize England and Scotland. In opposition to the king, a so called second Long Parliament has formed, in parallel to the situation in 1640 which led to the English Civil War. \n \nThis Long Parliament is determined to undermine the monarch’s authority. Now that parliament has practically seized control over the nation, another civil war is all but inevitable."
england.14.a:0 "Sounds bad."
england.15.t:0 "English Parliament Discusses Terms of Intervention"
england.15.d:0 "It has become abundantly clear that we will be left with no other option than intervening in Europe in the wake of the war of the Spanish Succession, however parliament is divided on the terms for such an intervention. Some believe that we should use the Spanish Succession crisis as a pretext to attack France, no matter the outcome, whilst others believe we should strictly act on the agreements of the treaty of London, meaning that in the case of Austria taking more than it has been promised, we shall if necessary, form an alliance with the French and counter the Austrians, if that is what it takes. This leaves the parliament with a choice between a radical anti-French stance, or a more pragmatic stance based on the outcome of the Spanish Crisis."
england.16.t:0 "England Proposes Military Cooperation"
england.16.d:0 "In light of the formation of a Spanish-Austrian axis, [ENG.GetName] has expressed concern about the disruption of the balance of power, and  they seek to enforce a more agreeable partition of Spain to maintain the stability of the European continent. As they increasingly fear Austria and Spain are emboldened by our relative isolation, [ENG.GetName] now reaches out to us to form a military cooperation pact to contain the Habsburg empire and enforce the treaty of London as was initially envisioned. It is however feared that England will abuse the situation for their own gain, rather than the intentions they state to us."
england.17.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Accepts Cooperation Pact"
england.17.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our offer, henceforth we will set aside our historic rivalry to enforce rational treaties for the good of all of Europe."
england.18.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses Cooperation Pact"
england.18.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has stubbornly refused our offer, prefering to rot alone in the fight against a Habsburg domination of the continent..."
england.19.d:0 "After the devastation left behind in Europe by the War of the Spanish Succession, there is near universal agreement among the Western Power that peace and stability has to be maintained throughout Europe. [FROM.GetName] has taken initiative in this, proposing a formation of the so-called Quadruple Alliance between [ENG.GetName], [FRA.GetName], [AUS.GetName], and [HOL.GetName] to ensure the treaties of the last war remain in effect. The biggest concern of the great powers is a revanchist Spain seeking to defile the treaties and once again plunge Europe into war. By forming a block between both friends and former enemies, England hopes to ensure Spain remains diplomatically isolated so that it will be dettered from starting any new wars. Altough it is not certain the coalition will succcesful, diplomats throughout Europe agree that this unprecedented new order in Europe might be the continents best hope of maintaining peace and the balance of power."

 william_III_DESC:0 "William III of England has ruled England, Scotland, and Ireland since 1689. Originally born in the Dutch Republic he inherited the Principality of Orange in Holland upon his birth, Giving him his widely used name William of Orange. In 1672 William became Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, and Overijssel. On the request of these states, he took charge of the United Provinces. William is a staunch Protestant, and many people see him as the defender of their faith. In 1677 William married Mary, oldest daughter of future King James II of England. He hoped this would improve his standing with England. William was constantly embroiled in conflict with the French king Louis XIV, who described him as ‘my mortal enemy’. This forced William to join several anti-French collations. Various anti-protestant reforms enacted by James II were making the predominantly Protestant English population extremely unhappy. Things finally came to a head when a group of powerful English Lords known ever after word as the ‘Immortal Seven’ sent William an invitation to invade England. On November 5, 1688, William landed in England starting the Glorious Revolution, Protestants flocked to his banner deserting James II, who fled to France. William fought various wars with Catholic pro James II supporters and Jacobite's while co ruling with his wife Mary. Most notably in Scotland and Ireland. When Mary died in 1694 of smallpox, William began to rule alone over England, though in recent years William’s popularity has fallen severely due to the lack of a Royal heir and a wife."
