 POR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The seventeenth century has not been kind to Portugal. Since the 1640's it had fought a bloody independence war against the Spanish, which was finally concluded by the treaty of Lisbon in 1668 under the rule of Pedro II 'The Pacific'. Portugal had participated in the nine-year war on the allied side, but Pedro has since sought to stay away from European politics. Portugal now stands at a crossroads. Will the eighteenth century see the Portuguese empire rise to glory, or will it be caught up in never ending European wars?"

 # Events:

 portugal.1.d:0 "Our situation at home is largely dependent on the other European states. Having re-emerged as a state in 1668 after a brutal restoration war against Spain since the 1640’s, we have had to rely on many allies. Having secured our victory thanks to both the French and the English, we owe them much.\n\nIt was however mainly the English who have become our main ally for the past few decades. The French on the other hand  have antagonized much of Europe, and most of who seek to join them join them mostly out of fear of being their next target. To the east of our borders, relations have vastly increased with the Spanish in recent years. After marrying the sister of the queen of Spain  a cordial relationship has developed between us and us once upon a time foes, keeping our country safe. .\n\nIn the recent decades we have also tried to carve a path of our own as we attempted to forge an alliance with Savoy, but unfortunately relations slightly broke down. .\n\nAs dark clouds now loom over Europe once more; we should carefully consider who we choose to focus on in the coming years."
 portugal.2.d:0 "We have been approached by ambassadors of Portugal requesting a treaty of non-aggression between our countries. Portugal, not wishing to get involved militarily in the current succession crisis, has sought a guarantee that we respect their non-belligerence. Despite their support for a certain faction in Spain, they have stated very clearly, they do not wish to go to war over another country’s dynastic politics. How shall we respond to Portugals non-aggression treaty?"
 portugal.3.d:0 "We have secured a non-aggression treaty with [FROM.GetCountry]. We shall have peace for now!"
 portugal.4.d:0 "Worrisome! [FROM.GetCountry] has stated they do not wish to make any diplomatic commitments towards keeping the peace."
 portugal.5.d:0 "Since 1662 Pedro II has been in charge of Portugal, after assuming the regency of his mother over his mentally unstable brother who he eventually banished to the Azores. Pedro has managed to consolidate Portugal’s independence by signing the treaty of Lisbon in 1668, officially bringing an end to the Portuguese Restoration war against Spain which has been raging since the 1640s. This has earned him the title ‘the pacific.’\n\nHe also managed to secure an alliance with England by marrying his sister to king Charles II of England, ceding Tanger and Bombay as a dowry. Relations have since broken down, because of the Dutch stadtholder William of Orange’s conquest of England.\n\nIn his long tenure, he has had many important accomplishments. Since 1674 he has mainly focused on improving the defences of the realm, and he has proven to be a patron of textile manufacturing. Pedro II is also notable for pursuing an absolutist rule, largely ignoring Portugal’s old political entities. In 1683, after the passing of his wife Marie-Françoise of Savoy, he has remarried to Maria Sophia of Neuburg, daughter of the Elector Palatine. She is also the sister of the queen of Spain, establishing friendly relations between the once rival realms. In conclusion, Pedro’s reign has brought peace and stability to the Portuguese empire, but as Europe marches to war once more, the future is uncertain."
 portugal.6.d:0 "Portugal has announced it shall stand by Carlos II's final wishes and has endorsed the candidature of [SPR.GetLeader]. The true intentions of this announcement are debatable, as many believe Portugal has mainly made the decision to appease its neighbour Spain and its allies. Even though Portugal has officially chosen a side in the upcoming conflict, it is at this stage looking unlikely that Portugal will want to militarily involve itself in any European conflict."
 portugal.7.d:0 "There has been a lot of controversy concerning the coronation of [SPR.GetLeader] as king of Spain, with both the international community and the Spanish divided over the issue. Now, in a major turn of events, Spain's closest neighbour Portugal has announced its support for the pretender Charles III as king of Spain. The ambassador of Portugal was immediately summoned to the Madrilene palace to go explain Portugal's actions in what is described as a major outrage. Some even fear, that Spain and Portugal might go to war over this diplomatic incident."
 portugal.8.d:0 "There has been a lot of controversy concerning the coronation of [SPR.GetLeader] as king of Spain, with both the international community and the Spanish divided over the issue. Now, in a major turn of events, Spain's closest neighbour Portugal has announced its support for the pretender Philip V as king of Spain. The ambassador of Portugal was immediately summoned to the Madrilene palace to go explain Portugal's actions in what is described as a major outrage. Some even fear, that Spain and Portugal might go to war over this diplomatic incident. Portugal is backed up by France, making a major escalation a very real possibility."
 portugal.9.d:0 "As a response of us not endorsing [SPR.GetLeader] as king of Spain, they have lodged a diplomatic protest against our nation. Whilst relations have been damaged, a further escalation seems to have been avoided."
 portugal.10.d:0 "As a response of us not endorsing [SPR.GetLeader] as king of Spain, they have now embargoed our nation. Whilst it is indeed damaging that we can no longer trade with the Spanish, we will surely find new alternatives to trade with other nations in Europe and the rest of our global empire. This hurts them more than it hurts us!"
 portugal.11.d:0 "Worrying news from Madrid. Word has it our ambassadors have been expelled and are on the way to Lisbon, carrying the news of a possibility of a declaration of war against our nation. Nobody in the Portuguese court would have expected such a drastic response, and we must now tread carefully the coming next days."
 portugal.12.d:0 "Outrage on the diplomatic stage in Madrid! The Portuguese have announced their support for the vile pretender of the throne and have their by denounced [SPR.GetLeader] as rightful king of Spain. This is an insult of the highest order, if not an indirect and outright declaration of war. The Portuguese ambassador was summoned to come explain himself, stating that Portugal does not seek war but simply has made this announcement as a matter of principle. The once strong relations with Portugal have now soured to a unimaginable low. Now it is up to the king to decide a satisfactory response to this diplomatic incident."
 portugal.13.d:0 "Portugal has sent us an offer to unite Iberia under one banner. We have long fought for our independence; will we really bow to new overlords now?"
 portugal.14.d:0 "Aragon has accepted unification. Their subjects will be treated well under the new united Iberia under Portuguese leadership. Now that the Iberian peninsula is united, the rest of Europe will think twice before pushing us around."
 portugal.15.d:0 "Aragon has agreed to becoming a Portuguese client state that holds significant autonomy. We have agreed to respecting their privileges, but of course in future a further integration is not excluded. We are happy and proud to declare Iberia unified under one common cause!"
 portugal.16.d:0 "Aragon has refused giving up their sovereignty, saying that they have fought for too long and too hard to simply hand it over. It would seem that unification will not happen through diplomatic means any time soon."
 portugal.17.d:0 "With The War of The Spanish Succession in the past, we must now look towards redefining our politics. One thing is for certain, Europe has consolidated and there is little opportunity to be had for Portugal, making the move to retreat from European affairs the most evident choice moving forward. That is to say mostly. The main goal will be to return to the maintenance and expansion of our colonial empire from which we had to refrain during the times of crisis in Europe."
 portugal.18.d:0 "Kongo is locked in a deadly civil war, and its quick conclusion would benefit Portugal greatly. Which side shall we support to ensure a quick outcome?"
 portugal.19.d:0 "Following centuries of infiltration, our country has been virtually turned into a Portuguese client state. They have now pressed to make this relation official, turning us into their subject. How shall we respond to this?"
 portugal.21.d:0 "Terrible news! King Pedro II has fallen chronically ill. Since the beginning of 1703 he has went through times of deep drowsiness, which doctor attribute to a 'downflow of estilicido', meaning a severe infection in the larynx. Even though the king new suffers this unfortunate illness, it is unlikely that it will threaten his life."
 portugal.22.d:0 "Worrying news from the capital! The king has been stricken by a 'legitimate pleurisy', that has derived from a seizure with which he has lost consciousness. Doctors have attempted a bloodletting, but the attacks keep getting worse and worse. It would appear, that our old king will soon be dead."
 portugal.23.d:0 "After a short period of severe suffering, Pedro II had made his final confessions before a priest and received the last holy sacrament, the anointing of the sick. He then summoned his sons for one last time, making them all vow to henceforth follow the will and wishes of his oldest son João, who will serve as his successor. Moments later, he finally passed away. João, who is the fifth of his name, has announced a period of mourning for one month after which he will properly assume his reign."

 succession.14.d:0 "As condition for their involvement in the war, Portugal has laid on the table some specific requests regarding territorial claims. First and foremost, the bare minimal demand was international recognition of their ownership of the colonial state of Brazil and Minas Gerais, which has at this stage has still not been granted to them. Secondly, they have demanded compensation either in the Americas or Europe based on their contribution in the war. It is however up to us, the leading power in this alliance, to decide whether we grant Portugal these demands."
