 france.1.t:0 "Death of William III"

We must announce our support for him, and if need be fund a military expedition so he can go reclaim the English throne, as is his birthright."
 france.1.a:0 "Yes, we must support the Old Pretender."
 france.2.t:0 "Huguenot terrorists destroy gun manufactury"

france.4.a:0 "They must pay for this!"
france.5.t:0 "France proposes economic integration."
france.5.d:0 "Representatives of the French crown have approached us with a rather intriguing proposal. Seeing the dire state of the Spanish economy, the French propose closer economic integration in a personal union between our realms. Whilst this will greatly boost our industrial capacity, experts warn us this may imply a loss of sovereignty and eventually turn us in a French vassal state."
france.5.a:0 "We graciously accept their proposal."
france.5.b:0 "We must refuse."
france.6.t:0 "Spain accepts economic integration"
france.6.d:0 "As was expected, the Spanish government has accepted stronger economic ties with our kingdom."
france.6.a:0 "Marvellous."
france.7.t:0 "Spain refuses economic integration"
france.7.d:0 "Quite ungratefully, Spain has refused further economic integration within the Bourbon realm."
france.7.a:0 "Regrettable."
france.8.d:0 "The French have approached us with a seemingly absurd offer in which they promise our independence if we rise up against our overlord England and join the French alliance. This so called renewed ‘Auld Alliance’ would see us as an independent state once more, that is, if we can beat the English at least."
france.8.t:0 "France proposes alliance"
france.8.a:0 "Absurd request!"
france.8.b:0 "We shall be independent once more!"

france.10.a:0 "A missed opportunity"
france.11.t:0 "France demands Corsica"
france.11.d:0 "France has demanded that we cede the island of Corsica. This appears to be yet another senseless move of agression made by the French king Louis XIV. Corsica is an integral part of our nation, however ceding it might be necessary to avoid a war with France."
france.11.a:0 "Cede the island."
france.11.b:0 "They will have to come and get it."
france.12.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] accepts our demands"

france.13.a:0 "Damn them!"
france.14.t:0 "Set up an Aragonese government?"
france.14.d:0 "Now that our troops have seized control over most of the Aragon region, our troops are spread thin trying to keep the order in the occupied provinces. One of our advisors has proposed installing an Aragonese puppet kingdom to keep the peace in the region. Indeed, the prospect is intriguing. The Aragonese nobility has already expressed a willingness to co-operate, so the choice is up to his majesty. "
france.14.a:0 "An excellent suggestion! Install the regime!"
france.14.b:0 "No, direct control over the region is preferable."
france.15.d:0 "Even though the chances of slipping past the Anglo-Dutch naval blockade were thought to have been slim, our Franco-Jacobite force made it through and has successfully disembarked in Firth of Forth. From this strategically well position location we can easily move our army into Edinburgh, from which it can stage a nation-wide Jacobite rebellion."
france.16.d:0 "Commander Claude de Forbin, who had warned us continuously that slipping past the Anglo-Dutch blockade would have been slim has been proven right, even though our troops made it all the way to the English coast, they were quickly intercepted by a British fleet after which they had to turn around to France as dismemberment seemed impossible. As they sailed into the Seine estuary most of the army seemed to have remained intact, although the sea did have a tool on life."
france.17.d:0 "Herald from the Scottish lowlands! Our local troops report that James Stuart's troops have successfully captured Edinburgh, setting the path for a full-fledged Jacobite rebellion. We do however still have enough influence to prevent James from travelling to Scotland."
france.18.d:0 "France has proposed us to become their official vassal. Even though our duchy has long enjoyed de facto independence, in truth we are in a complex situation where we are both the de jure vassal of the Emperor in Lorraine, and the vassal of France west of the Meuse river. Now, France has asserted its position and has requested to make this status official. Although it would most certainly anger the emperor, it is unlikely he will be able to muster a great enough force against France."
france.19.d:0 "Lorraine has accepted our proposal and has officially become a vassal within our kingdom."
france.20.d:0 "Lorraine has refuses, on grounds that it is officially bound as a part of the Holy Roman Empire and can therefore not officially become a subject of the kingdom of France."
france.21.d:0 "France has brought forth a proposal for Leopold I to give up his territories in Lorraine, for the much wealthier duchy of Milan. Leopold has long sought to rule over another realm than the unfortunate realm of Lorraine, which has been plagued by constant wars, mass emigration and a fractured domain. France has also promised Leopold, he could rule Milan completely independently."
france.22.d:0 "Leopold I has accepted our proposal, handing over Lorraine to France, as we hand him control over Milan which he can rule independently."
france.23.d:0 "Leopold I has ultimately refused our proposal. Even though he had long desired to rule Milan, he has passed down our proposal expressing his allegiance is greater to his people than to his personal ambitions. An ideal that can be respected, but an ideal that has hurt France nonetheless."
