 SPR_death_of_charles_II_desc:0 "After years of illness, the Spanish monarch has passed away. It is now up to the statesmen of Spain to decide how to handle the succession crisis that follows."
 SPR_bourbon_full:0 "Full Inheritance to Philip Bourbon"
 SPR_bourbon_full_desc:0 "Philip of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV, is the clear and only successor to the Spanish throne. As it was in the wishes of Charles II, his empire should not be divided amongst the great powers of Europe. Even though it is against the wishes of the English and the Austrians, the full inheritance should go to Philip V."
 SPR_bourbon_partition:0 "A Bourbon King, Partition with Austria"
 SPR_bourbon_partition_desc:0 "Whilst it is clear Philip is the rightful heir of Charles' empire, we must avoid a war at all costs and appease the other great powers of Europe. By carrying over part of our empire to the Austrians, we will surely be able to maintain the peace."
 SPR_habsburg_partition:0 "A Habsburg King, Partition with France"
 SPR_habsburg_partition_desc:0 "Charles III of Habsburg is the rightful heir of the Spanish throne, as it was clearly established during the London conference of 1700.

 SPR_habsburg_full:0 "Full inheritance to Archduke Charles"
 SPR_habsburg_full_desc:0 "The Habsburg archduke Charles is the rightful heir of the Spanish empire. Queen Maria Anna believed this quite determinedly, and she managed to convince her husband of that fact as he left it in his final will. It was also his will that the Spanish empire be given to Charles III in its entirety and that no partitions take place. Whilst we must execute the late king's wishes, it will likely lead to war in the future."
SPR_war_is_inevitable:0 "War is inevitable"

SPR_military_buildup:0 "Military Build-up"

SPR_crush_austrian_influence:0 "Eliminate Austrian Influence"
SPR_crush_austrian_influence_desc:0 "Before the death of Charles II, the Austrians had lobbied heavily in the Spanish court for a favourable succession that would serve the Austrian empire.

SPR_pontcarrero_place_in_adm:0 "Appoint Cardinal Portocarrero"
SPR_pontcarrero_place_in_adm_desc:0 "Cardinal Portocarrero played a pivotal role in the selection of Philip V as the sole heir of the Spanish throne. He had combatted the pro-Habsburg faction in the Spanish court vigorously, and it is even said that he himself made Charles II amend his final will moments before his death. Therefore, Portocarrero must be rewarded with a role within the new Bourbon administration so he can continue to serve us."
SPR_seek_papal_blessing:0 "Seek Papal Blessing"
SPR_seek_papal_blessing_desc:0 "There is not greater authority than the God himself. Since the pope speaks on his behalf, his blessing will surely convince the rest of Europe that Philip V is the rightful liege of Spain."
SPR_crush_inquisition:0 "Crush Inquisition"
SPR_crush_inquisition_desc:0 "The Spanish inquisition is too powerful an institution and undermines the absolutist principles Philip V has envisioned for Spain. Therefore it is time for the institution to seize to exist."
SPR_employ_inquisition:0 "Employ Inquisition"

SPR_reassure_investors:0 "Reassure Investors"
SPR_reassure_investors_desc:0 "The threat of war has kept away major investment from our country as people were preparing for yet another economic disaster. Now that a peaceful transition of power has happened, we can reassure the merchants that the Spanish economy may finally thrive once more."

SPR_destroy_french_influence:0 "Root Out French Influence"

SPR_build_up_pyrenees:0 "Build up the Pyrenees"
SPR_build_up_pyrenees_desc:0 "The Pyrenees, or at least the areas that are traversable, are our only direct border with France. It is therefore logical that France will invade through these mountains. We should fortify them as best as possible, so they cannot break through to the mainland."

SPR_spanish_recovery_plan:0 "Spanish Recovery Plan"
SPR_spanish_recovery_plan_desc:0 "The wars of the 17th century, and especially the Nine Years war have financially drained, nay, ruined our country. We must start an economic recovery plan immediately, before Spain permanently falls into chaos. Injecting some money into the economy, while increasing our costs, should help keep our factories working."
SPR_invest_in_the_capital:0 "Invest in the Capital"
SPR_invest_in_the_capital_desc:0 "Our capital Madrid is not as great as the other capitals of Europe, it is in dire need of redevelopment. It is time some money flowed to the city instead of the Escorial."

SPR_a_composite_monarchy:0 "A Composite Monarchy"

SPR_partition:0 "Partition"
SPR_partition_desc:0 "With neither side of the factions in our court being able to press demands for an integral succession, and an international climate pressing us to divide our realm, we are left with no other choice then to partition our empire between the French and the Austrians, along with some minor powers."

SPR_comfirm_succession_by_estates_desc:0 "The estates are the institution with the highest authority in Spain. We must consult with the estates to ensure a proper transaction of power.

SPR_appeal_to_aragonese_loyalists:0 "Appeal to Aragonese Loyalists"
SPR_appeal_to_aragonese_loyalists_desc:0 "Debates are raging in many of the Aragonese estates, like Valencia, Catalonia, the Baleares, Sicily and Sardinia. However, not every region is as likely to move to the opposition, so we should try to appeal to as many loyalists as possible."

SPR_invest_into_peru:0 "Invest into Peru"
SPR_invest_into_peru_desc:0 "Peru has brought many riches back home to Spain, but we have perhaps not given them as much in return. We shall make an investment, so that the colony can become even more profitable in the future."

SPR_establish_rio_de_la_plata_desc:0 "Peru has become too large to manage, and especially the southern region of La Plata has developed a character of its own. It is deemed best to create La Plata as a new entity, independent from the governor in Peru."
SPR_invest_into_new_spain:0 "Invest into New Spain"
SPR_invest_into_new_spain_desc:0 "New Spain is the crown jewel of our colonial empire and has brought us much profit throughout the years. If we inject some capital in the colony, we can surely expect to reap double the benefit within a short period of time."

SPR_break_up_new_spain_desc:0 "The Spanish main, also known as New Granada, is an area that has become significantly more important over the last couple of decades.

SPR_implement_anjouan_system:0 "Eliminate the Fueros"

SPR_abolish_conciliary_system:0 "Abolish Conciliary System"
SPR_abolish_conciliary_system_desc:0 "The Habsburg Conciliary System is an inefficient system granting too much power to the nobility and other interest groups.

SPR_carribean_investment:0 "Caribbean Investment"
SPR_carribean_investment_desc:0 "Even though the Caribbean is the first area settled by Europeans, and the main hub for international trade from the Americas, the many islands have remained relatively underdeveloped and underpopulated.

SPR_crush_the_republic_of_the_pirates_desc:0 "The self-proclaimed ‘Republic of The Pirates’ is an insult to civilization as we know it. This collection of heretics and uncivilized brutes must be wiped of the map before any more peasants and thugs are inspired by their life of sin."

SPR_strike_a_deal_with_pirates_desc:0 "Even though the pirates don't hold the same ideals as Spain, they are men, and men can be reasoned with. Since they could never win a war against the world, they need allies, or at least countries who would agree that they can continue to exist. The deal is simple: they leave alone the Spanish empire and disrupt English and Dutch traders, and we ignore them."
SPR_triangle_trade:0 "Triangle Trade"
SPR_triangle_trade_desc:0 "The trans-Atlantic slave trade is a profitable venture. European goods are sold to African states for slaves, slaves are brough to the Americas, the slaves produce plantation goods for Spain, and Spain turns a profit so it can in return buy more slaves. In conclusion, the triangle trade is pure profit for Spain!"
SPR_havana_plantations:0 "Havana Plantations"

SPR_make_a_bid_for_emperor_desc:0 "The title of Austria is more or less automatically bound to the title of Holy Roman Emperor. Now that we have brought Austria under our control, we shall usurp this title too."

SPR_remilitarize_the_low_countries_desc:0 "The barrier treaty foresees the neutrality of the Spanish Netherlands and allows only Dutch troops in the garrisons of the country to withstand an invasion by the French who have long tried to conquer the region.

SPR_spain_a_bourbon_throne_desc:0 "With the achievement of victory over the Grand Alliance, Spain has remained whole and a part of the most powerful dynastic sphere of influence in the world.

SPR_thrones_of_spain:0 "The Thrones of Spain"
SPR_thrones_of_spain_desc:0 "Spain is a composite monarchy of many thrones. In fact, Spain does no tofficially exist as a legal entity. Instead, it is a personal union of Castille, Leon, Asturias, Navarra, Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, the Baleares, Sicily, Sardinia, Naples, Flanders, Brabant, Luxemburg, Hainaut, and all the colonial possessions. Spain is a complex state, and that reality should be accepted."

# Events:
spain.1.t:0 "The Passing of Carlos II"
spain.1.d:0 "The long-awaited moment has finally arrived. After a short period of illness following a lifetime of suffering, the young king Carlos II has passed away after entering a coma. The autopsy records his 'heart was the size of a peppercorn; his lungs corroded; his intestines rotten and gangrenous; he had a single testicle, black as coal, and his head was full of water.' The nation is in mourning, and now anxiously awaits to hear who will succeed Carlos."
spain.3.t:0 "Aragon Revolts!"
spain.3.d:0 "Following rising tensions after the refusal by several noble estates of Aragon to recognize Philip V as the true successor of Charles II, they have rising up in arms and declared war on their former overlords. It is said that the Austrian archduke Charles III is already on his way to claim the crown offered to him by the Aragonese insurgents. After many years, the crowns of Castille and Aragon find themselves at war with one another again."
spain.4.d:0 "A Few Days after the Aragonese rebels have taken up arms against us, clashes at the Castilian-Aragonese border have finally begun. We are now officially at war with the Aragonese breakaway state."
spain.401.d:0 "We have defeated the traitors in Aragon. Their leaders have been executed and cities have been sacked. Now we can resume the order of the day."
spain.5.t:0 "Spain seeks Papal Blessing"
spain.5.d:0 "With the succession of Philip V, Spain now asks of his holiness the pope to give his blessing to legitimize the newly ascended dynasty."
spain.5.a:0 "Of course, they shall have our blessing."
spain.5.b:0 "Denounce the coronation!"
spain.6.t:0 "Maria Anna and Cardinal Portocarrero Compete for the King's Ear"
spain.6.d:0 "With the health of Charles II deteriorating, the actual power of the monarch came into the hands of powerful advisors in the court. The most influential of these people were Maria Anna, Charles' Wife, and cardinal Portocarrero, an ambitious clergyman.\n \nThe two regularly clash over Charles' will. Maria Anna is in favour of an Austrian successor to the throne, whilst Portocarrero is strongly pro-Bourbon.\n \nWith Charles' health worsening, one of these advisors must be appointed as designated regent. Not an easy choice, as it may have a deep impact on future developments in Europe."
spain.6.a:0 "Stay loyal to Maria Anna."
spain.6.b:0 "Portocarrero has superior knowledge of statesmanship!"
spain.7.t:0 "The Pope grants his blessing!"
spain.7.d:0 "His Holiness has officially announced support for the ascension of Philip V to the Spanish Throne. With this confirmation by the Pope we have secured a position for the Bourbon dynasty on the Spanish throne."
spain.7.a:0 "Excellent news!"
spain.8.t:0 "The Pope denounces Philip V's coronation!"
spain.8.d:0 "Rather outrageously, the Pope has decided to denounce our claims to the Spanish Realm, stating it would 'upset the balance of power in Europe'."
spain.8.a:0 "Who cares about the Pope's opinion these days?"
spain.9.t:0 "Habsburg faction dominates the Spanish court"
spain.9.d.a:0 "It has come to our attention that the pro-Habsburg faction has come to dominate our court. If the current trends remain, we can expect our nation to remain a Habsburg monarchy, after the passing of Carlos II whose health is more fragile than ever."
spain.9.d.b:0 "Bad news! Our spies in Madrid report that the Habsburg faction which supports Charles of Austria as the heir to Carlos II is dominating the Spanish court. If nothing is done about this situation, yet another Habsburg will sit upon the Spanish throne!"
spain.10.t:0 "Bourbon faction dominates the Spanish court"
spain.10.d.a:0 "It has come to our attention that the pro-Bourbon faction has come to dominate our court. The more friendly approach to France by the court, might mean our country will soon be led by a Bourbon, ending two centuries of Habsburg reign."
spain.10.d.b:0 "Bad news! Our spies in Madrid report that the Bourbon faction which supports Philip of Anjou as the heir to Carlos II is dominating the Spanish court. If nothing is done about this situation, centuries of Habsburg domination of Spain might come to an end!"
spain.11.d:0 "Today a large treasure fleet has arrived in Spain, bringing tons of gold, silver, and other precious metals. Celebration is in order, for this treasure fleet has brought in one of the biggest cargos in years!"
spain.12.d:0 "A treasure fleet has arrived in Spain, bringing enough gold to support the maintenance of our empire for months to come, all from a few ships!"
spain.13.d:0 "A small treasure fleet has arrived in Spain. While the saying goes 'One should not look a gift horse in the mouth', the contents of the ship's cargo are somewhat disappointing, as it is barely half full..."
spain.14.d:0 "One of our treasure fleets which had departed in Havana several weeks ago, is still nowhere to be seen. It would appear that the fleet carrying the cargo was somehow lost at sea, or worse, captured by pirates. Unfortunately, we might never know the fate of this fleet!"
spain.15.t:0 "Carlos II falls ill"
spain.15.d:0 "The king has fallen terribly ill. While King Carlos has always had a fragile health to begin with, it is now apparent that his health is beginning to fail completely. With a succession crisis looming, the country is now waiting anxiously for Carlos to draw his final breath."
spain.16.t:0 "Estates of Castille support Philip"
spain.16.d:0 "Following a slight confusion throughout Europe following Philip's ascension to the Spanish throne, the Estates of our various holdings have gathered throughout the realm to ratify Philip's coronation. Today, Philip has secured his first major victory, as the estates of Castille have announced their support for his reign."
spain.17.t:0 "Estates of Aragon remain divided"
spain.17.d:0 "While the estates of the kingdom of Castille were quick to announce their support for Philip, the estates of the kingdom of Aragon remain very divided. The crown of Aragon is comprised of various duchies, namely Majorca, Valencia, Aragon, Catalonia, Sicily, Sardinia, and Naples. As some delegates have called upon their colleagues to support the Austrian candidate Charles of Austria instead, uncertainty looms over the nation, and we will have to apply pressure on the estates of the said regions."
spain.18.t:0 "Majorca Announces Support for Philip"
spain.18.d:0 "The estates of Majorca have voted, and have agreed to unanimously support king Philip, whatever happens. A good day for the king!"
spain.19.t:0 "Majorca Announces Support for Charles"
spain.19.d:0 "The estates of Majorca have gathered and have voted to support Charles of Austria instead of their rightful king Philip! The territories can now be considered as disloyal to the crown."
spain.20.t:0 "Sardinia Announces Support for Philip"
spain.20.d:0 "The estates of Sardinia have voted, and have agreed to unanimously support king Philip, whatever happens. A good day for the king!"
spain.21.t:0 "Sardinia Announces Support for Charles"
spain.21.d:0 "The estates of Sardinia have gathered and have voted to support Charles of Austria instead of their rightful king Philip! The territories can now be considered as disloyal to the crown."
spain.22.t:0 "Valencia Announces Support for Philip"
spain.22.d:0 ""The estates of Valencia have voted, and have agreed to unanimously support king Philip, whatever happens. A good day for the king!""
spain.23.t:0 "Valencia Announces Support for Charles"
spain.23.d:0 "The estates of Valencia have gathered and have voted to support Charles of Austria instead of their rightful king Philip! The territories can now be considered as disloyal to the crown."
spain.24.t:0 "Who should we announce our support to?"
spain.24.d:0 "The estates of the Viceroyalty of Naples have gathered in Naples. Now it is time for the nation to decide which side of the conflict between Philip V and Charles III to support."
spain.25.t:0 "Naples Announces Support for Philip"
spain.25.d:0 "The estates of Naples have voted, and have agreed to unanimously support king Philip, whatever happens. A good day for the king!"
spain.26.t:0 "Naples Announces Support for Charles"
spain.26.d:0 "The estates of Naples have gathered and have voted to support Charles of Austria instead of their rightful king Philip! The territories can now be considered as disloyal to the crown."
spain.27.t:0 "Aragon Announces Support for Philip"
spain.27.d:0 "The estates of Aragon have voted, and have agreed to unanimously support king Philip, whatever happens. A good day for the king!"
spain.28.t:0 "Aragon Announces Support for Charles"
spain.28.d:0 "The estates of Aragon have gathered and have voted to support Charles of Austria instead of their rightful king Philip! The territories can now be considered as disloyal to the crown."
spain.29.t:0 "Catalonia Announces Support for Philip"
spain.29.d:0 "The estates of Catalonia have voted, and have agreed to unanimously support king Philip, whatever happens. A good day for the king!"
spain.30.t:0 "Catalonia Announces Support for Charles"
spain.30.d:0 "The estates of Catalonia have gathered and have voted to support Charles of Austria instead of their rightful king Philip! The territories can now be considered as disloyal to the crown."
spain.31.t:0 "Sicily Announces Support for Philip"
spain.31.d:0 "The estates of Sicily have voted, and have agreed to unanimously support king Philip, whatever happens. A good day for the king!"
spain.32.t:0 "Sicily Announces Support for Charles"
spain.32.d:0 "The estates of Sicily have gathered and have voted to support Charles of Austria instead of their rightful king Philip! The territories can now be considered as disloyal to the crown."
spain.33.t:0 "Castilian Opposition"
spain.33.d:0 "The Castilian nobility is divided over the issue of supporting their rightful king Charles III, as some of them have instead chosen to support the vile pretender Philip of Anjou. The monarchy will have to deal with this issue quickly, or else we might face a civil war."
spain.34.t:0 "Aragonese Estates Support Charles III"
spain.34.d:0 "The regional estates of Aragon have declared outspoken support for the new Habsburg king, vowing to serve their king at all costs. This support is most welcome in our time of need."
spain.35.t:0 "Bourbon Meddling in Navarra"
spain.35.d:0 "Reports have come in of unrest in the Basque region of Navarra, where an outspoken support for Philip of Anjou exists. Our advisors agree however, that this support exists not out of true convictions, but because of lies and French propaganda."
spain.36.d:0 "Unrest in the capital! A couple hundred Burghers and urban nobles have come on the streets to protest the coronation of Carlos III. Whilst the protests are relatively peaceful, the city garrison awaits a course of action before the situation escalates."
spain.37.d:0 "A violent mob is running rampant in Andalusia. Word has it that both peasants and craftsmen alike are rioting after having been incited by a couple of disloyal local nobles. The mob has already destroyed a couple of important manufactories, and swift action is required before they do even more damage."
spain.38.d:0 "We have received a report from the local officer of the law in Valladolid that a nobleman giving an inspirational speech in support of the king, was violently murdered after the event. Unknown thugs, likely hired by disloyal nobility, have abducted, murdered and dismembered the nobleman and have sent his remains to the town hall of Valladolid to send out a message. It is without doubt that this tragedy is beyond barbarism."
spain.39.d:0 "Following their local fiefs, a large amount of peasants and professional soldiers have defected from the Spanish crown. This large desertion is starting to create some worry amongst our chief advisors, fearing that a civil war is all but inevitable."
spain.40.d:0 "About a week ago, a man was arrested in Léon after having been caught setting fire to a large pottery manufactory. The man is clearly linked to a pro-Bourbon organisation seeking to overthrow the Habsburg dynasty in Spain. Now the man must stand trial for his actions, and his punishment shall be..." 
spain.41.d:0 "After organising for months now underground, what seems like a war camp has formed around the outskirts of La Mancha, numbering about 20.000 men. They are likely planning on marching to Madrid and grant the Spanish Crown to Philip V. Whilst it seems like nothing can avert this crisis any longer, there still might be a small change for diplomacy to work."
spain.42.d:0 "The rapprochement in La Mancha of the army was a success. Indeed, the rebels saw reason, that for their demands to be reached there is no need for all-out war and replacing the ruling dynasty. One thing is clear, if we want to remain in power, then we will have to make major concessions. Even though civil war is averted for the time being, it might not be long before they take up arms again."
spain.43.d:0 "After months of building tensions an ultimatum was received in the royal Alcazar of Madrid. Abdicate or Face Rebellion. In all clarity, by no means this letter represents all of the Castilian nobility. Whilst many of them do have some discontent with the government, only a vast minority has decided to properly join this rebellion. Castille now faces yet another civil war which might determine the fate of Spain for years to come."
spain.44.d:0 "The last of the rebels have been routed, and Spain is once again united. Now that the civil war is over, it is time to rebuild and mend the old wounds."
spain.45.d:0 "Following the defeat of our alliance in the last war, Spain has sought to immediately reignite the conflict as it does not want to settle by the terms of the treaty of Utrecht. We had however made very clear agreements with the other great powers of Europe that such a war cannot happen again. Our nation is exhausted by war, and we are bound to international treaties. Spain stands on its own."
spain.46.d:0 "Following the defeat of our alliance in the last war, Spain has sought to immediately reignite the conflict as it does not want to settle by the terms of the treaty of London. We had however made very clear agreements with the other great powers of Europe that such a war cannot happen again. Our nation is exhausted by war, and we are bound to international treaties. Spain stands on its own."
spain.47.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has decided they cannot support our rightful claims and have decided to abandon us. A black day for diplomacy!"
spain.48.d:0 "The kingdom of Spain has announced that it does not find itself able to ratify the partition treaties posed upon the nation. Instead, they shall actively try to regain the lands 'stolen' from them through the partitions. Even though Spain thus far appears to be standing alone, it is most certainly a concern for the newly gained peace in Europe."
spain.49.d:0 "We have successfully launched an invasion against the occupied territory of Sardinia. Now, it is once again united with Spain. As we had expected, the Allies have failed to act against this move, and we are free to proceed to recover our Italian lands."
spain.50.d:0 "Spain has launched an invasion against the allied duchy of Sardinia and has secured the island. Spain claims it is merely walking in its own backyard, as it has failed to recognize the implications of the previously agreed partition treaties. If we are to uphold these treaties, we must speak out against such actions and take military steps if necessary."
spain.51.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has announced diplomatic sanctions against our nation following our rightful liberation of Sardinia. It is starting to become clear that the allied powers of Europe seek to destabilize and undermine our nation for their own personal gain."
spain.53.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has refused the return of our rightful territories!"
spain.54.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has returned Gibraltar back to our nation, proving that they still have some decency in them left after all!"
spain.55.d:0 "We have successfully made contact with James Stuart. Stuart, who had previously been in court in exile in France has had to find a new patron as France abandoned his cause after the formation of an alliance with England. Now he is most pleased to have learned that we have offered him a similar patronage and even a prospect to take back his place as king of England."
spain.56.d:0 "After France officially suspended its support for the Old Pretender, we had thought we would be safe. Now, our ambassadors in Spain have gathered intel that the Old Pretender is actively planning his return in cooperation with the Spanish monarchy. The return of the old enemy seems all but inevitable."
spain.57.d:0 "Tragedy has struck the French court! Even though his majesty king Louis XIV seemed in good health until very recently, his health had rapidly deteriorated leading up to his death within 48 hours. Physicians are perplexed by the possible causes, but they have ruled out any known poison. Most likely, the old king had suffered a sudden heart attack, putting his decade-long glorious rule of reforms and successful wars to a sudden end. Luckily, the succession is safe, as France looks towards the future."
spain.58.d:0 "We have discovered a Spanish murder plot, seeking to assassinate our King, Louis XIV. A Spanish diplomat/spy was caught red handed as he was putting poison in King Louis' favourite Bourbon, from which he is known to drink in his private time. The poison is unlike anything we have seen before. Were it not that the spy was discovered in Louis XIV's private chambers by a maid, we would never have known that it was the Spanish who were behind his death. Whilst the Spanish motives are uncertain, one thing is for certain. They have committed the highest crime against God, and now they must pay the price in full."
spain.59.d:0 "A worst case scenario has become a bitter reality. Our spy, trying to make his move in Versailles, has most likely been discovered. Whilst we do not know for now whether the French have discovered the full extent of the mission, we should prepare for retaliation."
spain.60.d:0 "It would seem that our spy we have sent to Versailles has been unsuccessful at completing his mission of assassinating Louis XIV. Whilst we could stage another attempt, we could as well wait for the ageing king to pass away from natural causes. After all, Philip has a long a bright life still to live."
spain.61.d:0 "In a personal letter from [SPR.GetLeader], the king of Spain, he proposes that the time has come for [FRA.GetLeader] to abdicate the throne in favour of [SPR.GetLeader]. He has stated that this will strengthen the position of both France and Spain in the hard times to come, especially with the old members of the Grand Alliance seeking revenge."
spain.62.d:0 "For a long time, the Low Countries have been a thorn in our side. The area is costly to maintain, difficult to defend, and not bringing us much economic gain due to the heavy sanctions imposed on the area. Long have we sought to get rid of the low countries, and now that interest in the area seems to be increasing, we might be able to fetch a good price for them. The question ultimately remains, who will we sell them to?"
spain.63.d:0 "We have received an offer from Spain. Spain has long sought to rid themselves of the Southern Netherlands, as it is not in their strategic interests to hold on to the area any longer. They now have approached us to sell the region for a decent price. How shall we respond to their offer?"
spain.64.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has refused our offer to purchase the Southern Netherlands. It strangely almost seems like no power in Europe is really interested in the area. Now we can choose to either keep the area, or try to find another buyer."
spain.65.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our offer and now the Southern Netherlands are no longer a sovereign part of the Spanish empire. The compensation received from the sale is quite a hefty sum, setting up our economy for the next few years."
spain.66.d:0 "Our king has died unexpectedly, and has been succeeded by his son Charles, who also happened to be king of Spain. The unification of our two kingdoms seems to be near."
spain.67.d:0 "Our king Charles III has become the archduke of Austria, placing our countries in a personal union! Now it is up to him to decide how to rule these two states."
spain.69.d:0 "The Spanish Emperor has decided to revoke the privilegia, putting an end to our mostly independent rule. However, many believe it is not too late to resist this Spanish power grab!"
spain.72.d:0 "We have received a worrying threat from [FROM.GetName]! They have declared a hegemony over all of Europe, and now seek our subjugation. They have stated it would be a question of time before the rest of Europe would follow, and resisting is pointless. How shall we respond to this outrageous threat?"
spain.73.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has resisted our demands to be subjugated and have chosen to fight instead. They shall be tested in battle!"
spain.74.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our demands and are now loyal vassals of our empire."
spain.75.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has demanded that we give up Artois, as a rightful part of the Spanish realm. They seek this concession as a reparation of the wars past, and as a reversal of treaties of old in which we had previously brough the area under our control."
spain.76.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our demands, increasing relations between our two great nations and averting another crisis over land. Indeed, the pen is mightier than the sword!"
spain.77.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has refused our demands. Whilst it has come as no surprise, we had hoped for a better outcome of these events. Now that we have claims, it will be up to us to decide wether to press them or not."
spain.78.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has demanded that we give up Franche-Comté, as a rightful part of the Spanish realm. They seek this concession as a reparation of the wars past, and as a reversal of treaties of old in which we had previously brough the area under our control."
spain.79.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our demands, increasing relations between our two great nations and averting another crisis over land. Indeed, the pen is mightier than the sword!"
spain.80.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has refused our demands. Whilst it has come as no surprise, we had hoped for a better outcome of these events. Now that we have claims, it will be up to us to decide whether to press them or not."
spain.82.t:0 "The State of the Colonies"
spain.82.d:0 "The colonies of Spain are facing severe challenges, despite their abundance of precious metals such as silver and gold. Years of continuous wars and mismanagement have depleted our treasury, leaving us in a dire financial situation. Additionally, our restrictive mercantile laws, which limit trade to Spanish merchants only, have encouraged rampant smuggling by merchants from other nations. In fact, foreign nations receive more of our profits than we do! This illicit trade has led to significant losses in profits for the Empire, as contraband circuits thrive.\n\nMoreover, the massive influx of cash from the colonies has resulted in severe inflation, destabilizing our economy. This influx of wealth has also hindered industrial development within mainland Spain. To make matters worse, the colonies heavily rely on shipments from the mainland to sustain their towns and ports as they have not been developed adaquately. With our diminishing military presence in the New World, our trading laws are increasingly violated, exacerbating the situation. Furthermore, numerous issues such as inefficient tolls and tariffs, corrupt Spanish merchants and governors, and flawed policies have exacerbated the damage.\n\nIt is evident that comprehensive reforms are urgently needed to revitalize the colonies and preserve our overseas Empire.."
spain.83.t:0 "The Council of the Indies"
spain.83.d:0 "The Council of the Indies is the most important administrative organ for our overseas colonies, and it supervises the East Indies as well as the Americas. Although it's importance has been divided ever since the formation of the Council of Finance and other bodies which took over certain aspects of the Council's duties, it continues to be the main administrative body for our overseas colonies. Ever since the 16th century the power and competence of the Council has been on the decline, with unqualified councillors, a general ignorance of the colonies, and a host of other problems plague the Council, which has led to rampant corruption and blatant disregard for our trading laws. Much work must be done in order to restore the Council to it's original glory."
spain.84.t:0 "Integrating the Trade Circuits"
spain.84.d:0 "The process of integrating the various smuggling rings and illegal trade circuits across our colonies has begun, it is expected to take some time. We should be able to gain quite a lot of extra income from these smugglers."
spain.85.t:0 "Trade Circuits Integrated"
spain.85.d:0 "The illegal trade circuits have been integrated, and we have gained several new sources of income. It will be put to good use!"
spain.86.t:0 "Pirate Strongholds Destroyed!"
spain.86.d:0 "The last pirate stronghold in our Caribbean colonies has been destroyed! This is a severe blow to the pirates and will no doubt lead to a further decrease in smuggling and piracy."


# Treaty of Utrecht:
FRA_defeated_flag:0 "The Bourbon Alliance has signed an armistice."
succession.1.t:0 "Grand Alliance demands surrender"
succession.1.d:0 "As the war has turned in the favour of the Grand Alliance, we stand on the verge of disaster. The representatives of the Grand Alliance have approached us with terms of surrender. An armistice will be signed, after which mainly parts of the Spanish empire will be transferred to the allies. France itself, should remain largely untouched."
succession.2.t:0 "Fate of the Southern Netherlands"
succession.2.d:0 "Following the surrender of the Bourbon Alliance, ambassadors of the major involved parties have corresponded intensively to set up the terms for a renewed peace throughout Europe. One of the key regions at play is the Southern Netherlands, formerly under the control of Spain. Many options are on the table, and admittedly none of them are even close to perfect."
succession.3.t:0 "Choose a recipient for the Netherlands"
succession.3.d:0 "As none of the other options suited our goals, we have opted to grant the Southern Netherlands to another power. Who do we think is best suited for the ownership of the region?"
succession.4.t:0 "Fate of Sardinia"
succession.4.d:0 "With the defeat of Spanish and French forces in Sardinia, it is time to decide the fate of the island. The great powers are still puzzled whether to grant the state to Austria as was promised, create a brand-new state, let it remain with Spain, or give it to another belligerent."
succession.5.t:0 "Choose a recipient for Sardinia"
succession.5.d:0 "As none of the other options suited our goals, we have opted to grant Sardinia to another power. Who do we think is best suited for the ownership of the region?"
succession.6.t:0 "Fate of Naples"
succession.6.d:0 "We have yet to decide the fate of Naples. In previous agreements, it was decided to kingdom of Naples was to be given to Austria, but of course we can negotiate a different deal based upon the war participation."
succession.7.t:0 "Choose a recipient for Naples"
succession.7.d:0 "As not of the other options suited our goals, we have opted to grant Naples to another power. Who do we think is best suited for the ownership of the region?"
succession.8.t:0 "Fate of Sicily"
succession.8.d:0 "The strategically vital and wealthy island of Sicily has come under the control of Grand Alliance forces. Now it is time to decide the fate of the island which might have serious implications on the future of Europe. Originally it was intended for the island to be handed to Sardinia for its participation in the war, but the final decision still rests with the leader of the faction."
succession.9.t:0 "Choose a recipient for Sicily"
succession.9.d:0 "As none of the other options suited our goals, we have opted to grant Sicily to another power. Who do we think is best suited for the ownership of the region?"
succession.10.t:0 "English Naval Bases in the Mediterranean" 
succession.10.d:0 "Whilst England's primary goal had been to maintain the balance of power in Europe, it obviously had also foreseen some expansion in the Mediterranean to secure its vital strategic interests."
succession.11.t:0 "Fate of the Slave trade Monopoly"
succession.11.d:0 "The Slave trade Monopoly was perhaps one of the most lucrative businesses in the 18th century and many powers had competed for the so called Asiento de Negros rights granted by Spain. Although the monopoly originally belonged to the Dutch and English, it was later transfer to France. Now the monopoly is once again up for grabs."
succession.12.t:0 "Fate of Milan"
succession.12.d:0 "Lombardy is perhaps one of the most sensitive matters out of the whole congress. Originally, the question of Milan was one of the prime reasons why Austria would not ratify the treaty of London in 1700. Whilst it is obvious the Austrian claim to the region is the strongest, it is still up to the delegates to decide the fate of the region."
succession.13.t:0 "Choose a recipient for Milan"
succession.13.d:0 "As none of the other options suited our goals, we have opted to grant Milan to another power. Who do we think is best suited for the ownership of the region?"
succession.20.t:0 "Bourbon Alliance demands surrender"
succession.20.d:0 "As the Bourbon Alliance continues to make advances, the odds of victory seem ever more unlikely. The Bourbon representatives have sent a letter to our chancellery, offering favourable terms of surrender. Seeing how the war is virtually lost, it might be the only choice we have, other than face compete annihilation."
succession.21.t:0 "The future of the English regime"
succession.21.d:0 "One could most certainly say that the French regime is at odds with the English. Originally, France has recognized the Stuart line of king James, known as 'the old pretender', in England. Now that the fate of England is in our hands, we can decide upon such a matter. We could either grant James Stuart free reign, make him a puppet king, or compromise with the current monarchy of England without making any drastic political changes."
succession.22.t:0 "The fate of England"
succession.22.d:0 "Now that the political question of England has been dealt with, we are now faced with the question of the territorial integrity of England. One can most definitely say that England has a comfortable position now that it has consolidated the British Isles. A strong and independent Ireland, or an independent Wales, however, could prove to be vital allies in the future wars to come."

succession.23.d:0 "Not only England, but also Scotland is an important player in the British Isles. Since they are ruled by the same monarch for the better part of the century however it has allowed the English monarch to stay safe on the British Isles. This congress now allows us to change the situation and grant Scotland a new role on the stage of international politics."
succession.24.t:0 "The fate of the Netherlands"
succession.24.d:0 "The Netherlands, one of the greatest rivals of France, now stands defeated. This creates great opportunities for France to decide the future of the small but troublesome country."
succession.25.t:0 "The Fate of North America"
succession.25.d:0 "North America was a theatre of war that saw harder fighting than ever before. It has become apparent, that the importance of borders extends far beyond our European interests, and we should look at a new arrangement in North America."
succession.26.t:0 "The Fate of the Caribbean"
succession.26.d:0 "Long have other European powers unrightfully interfered in Spain's affairs in the Caribbean. Now we can finally right these wrongs. On the other hand, we could be benefited by not consolidating the Caribbean too much."

succession.28.t:0 "The Fate of Aragon"
succession.28.d:0 "The Aragonese struggle for independence has ended in a shameful defeat. Now we must decide how to handle the future of these territories, and particularly Catalonia which has been more troublesome than the other states."
succession.29.t:0 "The Fate of Austria, the Hungarian question"
succession.29.d:0 "The Hungarians have fought against all odds against the Austrians. Now that the war is over, it is time to find a lasting compromise for the Hungarian question."

The Bourbon representatives have sent a letter to our chancellery, offering favourable terms of surrender. Seeing how the war is virtually lost, it might be the only choice we have, other than face compete annihilation. The execution of Treaty of London, is imminent."
succession.41.t:0 "Executing The Treaty Of London"
succession.41.d:0 "After a lengthy but successful war with the Habsburg alliance, victory has been achieved and the threat of a new Habsburg dominance in Europe has passed. Now, the stipulations of the treaty of London have to be followed. France is to receive Naples, Sicily, and the Spanish province of Gipuzkoa as well as the Duchy of Milan. The Spanish and Austrian thrones can never merge. This way, peace will be kept all over Europe."
succession.60.t:0 "Habsburg Alliance demands surrender"
succession.60.d:0 "As the Habsburg Alliance continues to make advances, the odds of victory seem ever more unlikely. The Habsburg representatives have sent a letter to our chancellery, offering favourable terms of surrender. Seeing how the war is virtually lost, it might be the only choice we have, other than face compete annihilation. A new era of Habsburg dominance, is upon us."
succession.61.t:0 "Fate of France"
succession.61.d:0 "After a hard-fought battle the French have finally accepted their defeat against our superior Habsburg forces. Now that the war is over, it is time for us to decide how to best handle France. They should not be punished to severely, so we do not stoke any revanchist sentiment, but on the other hand they should be sufficiently weakened so they would not dare to oppose us again."

succession.80.d:0 "After a long and determined fight, the Bourbon Alliance has been forced to come to terms with a harsh reality: The war they had so desperately wanted to win, has been lost. The powers of the Grand Alliance have emerged victorious, and now delegates of both sides of the conflict are gathering in Utrecht to discuss the terms of a peace treaty. One key principle has already been established, and that is that neither France nor Spain will be punished too severely, and the main goal of the new peace treaty will be restoring the balance of power in Europe to prevent new major wars. Even though there is hope that this war will have been the war to end all wars, many are sceptical and worry for the future of Europe, especially as a partitioned Spain will likely not sit and watch as its empire gets torn apart."
succession.81.d:0 "The Bourbon Alliance stands victorious. After gathering a large coalition of anti-Bourbon nations, the Grand Alliance under the leadership of England has had to come to terms with the overwhelming military power of the combined forces of France and Spain. Although the Grand Alliance had initially hoped to gather a large coalition to cripple France and Spain, both nations have proven to be a formidable force. Especially the long thought to have been weakened Spanish empire has proven to be stronger than originally anticipated. Now the delegates of all nations have gathered in Versailles, where the Bourbon alliance will announce its plans to redraw the map of Europe. The Bourbon domination of Europe has never been closer."
succession.82.d:0 "Battered and beaten, the Habsburg Alliance was forced to accept defeat. Facing heavy setbacks in both Spain and Austria, the Habsburgs have sued for peace after what seemed an irreversible military situation. Now, their enemies seek the execution of the treaty of London, as agreed upon in 1700. Austria will be severely humiliated, whilst Spain faces the loss of a substantial part of their European possessions in Italy."
succession.821.d:0 "Following the defeat of the Habsburg Alliance by France and her allies, the decision was made in agreement with [ENG.GetName] to enforce the terms of treaty of London as agreed upon in 1700. The first clause of the new treaty is the establishment of the fact that Austria and Spain may never unite their thrones, and thus Charles III is excluded from any form of succession to the Austrian Habsburg throne. Furthermore it is agreed that whilst Austria will remain intact, Spain must cede its Italian possessions to France, as previously established in the treaty of London. They must also cede the small Basque possession of Gipuzkoa to France. Gibraltar and Menorca will be ceded to England. Finally, the overseas American empire will remain intact, but Spain is forced to recognize English and French possessions in the Caribbean.\n\nAs the treaty concludes itself, most diplomats and ambassadors throughout Europe are mostly happy with the outcome of the war, as this new treaty will likely restore the balance of power in Europe, thus securing peace for generations to come."
succession.83.d:0 "The Habsburg Alliance has emerged victorious in a long struggle against France and its allies. Now a peace conference will take place in Vienna, where the Habsburg alliance will draw up plans to carve up Europe in the name of the Habsburg alliance, securing their place in Europe as dominant hegemon for another century at least."
succession.84.d:0 "Your faction has been defeated! Your enemies have secured all victory conditions, and the leader of your faction has accepted an armistice. Now, the opposing faction will organise a peace conference, in which their faction leader will divide the spoils of wars between its allies."
succession.85.d:0 "Your faction has stood victorious and the war has been won! For now, and armistice has been signed. The leader of your faction will now be able to divide the spoils of war in a peace conference via the §GDecisions§! tab."

 CARLOS_II_DESC:0 "Carlos II of Spain, often nicknamed 'El Hechizado' (meaning 'The Bewitched'), has ruled as king of Spain since  his ten-year regency, beginning in 1665, and belongs to the Spanish Habsburg dynasty.  Rife with ailments and weaknesses, he’s been carried everywhere in lieu of walking since age eight, when his mother suggested as much.  In addition, his lame and shrivelled genitalia have left him unable to father offspring thus far, and his physical and mental disabilities have addled his romantic and social life, to say nothing of his education, which ended at the same time that he gave up walking.\n\nDespite his personal disabilities, the integrity of the Spanish crown is vast, with a sweeping empire and many subjugated kingdoms beneath him.  His half-brother, the infamous John Joseph of Austria, was a wise and tactful military leader until his death in 1679.  Forever embittered by his treatment at the hands of his mother as well as the political strife that plagued his early years, his reign has been one of blood and iron rule.  Marred by conflicts with France, to say nothing of his marriage to Marie Louise of Orléans, he maintains an ever-strenuous relationship with his northern neighbors.\n\nNow the question of succession looms overhead.  Unable to father any children thus far, most doctors rule out his likelihood of appointing a blood successor as nonexistent.  To make matters worse, the French and Austrian Habsburgs are sizing up the crown of Spain with each passing minute and seem increasingly willing to seize it by any means necessary.  With her Empire on the brink of collapse and her enemies already preparing their own draft of her will, Spain’s fate lies in the weakly-clenched hands of Carlos El Hechizado, supposedly the last of the Spanish Habsburgs."
