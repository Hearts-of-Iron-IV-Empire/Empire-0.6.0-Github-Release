 mod.0.t:0 "Welcome to Empire: Into the Orient!"
 mod.0.d:0 "Welcome to the §G0.6.0§! version of the §GEmpire Mod§!, featuring multiple reworks and the Mughal-Maratha War. The mod has no official end-date, but the game should last for about as long as you have content in your focus tree and beyond. This mod has deliberatly chosen not to implement or rework any major mechanics, with the sole exception of the colonization mechanics which are completly optional for the player to mess around with. In the current version, there is not yet an option to toggle historical versus ahistorical ai, so expect many different outcomes and experiences whilst playing different nations."
 mod.1.t:0 "The death of Charles II of Spain"
 mod.1.d:0 "Toward the end of his life, Charles II’s fragile health deteriorated. He died on the 1st of November 1700, five days before his 39th birthday. Because Charles had no sons, it was decided that his empire was to be divided between Austria and France. It remains to be seen whether or not this agreement will be honoured."
 mod.2.t:0 "Philip V crowned king of Spain"
 mod.2.d:0 "The Spanish regency council has announced the will of the late king Charles II of Spain. Against all previous agreements, the empire is to be inherited in full by Philip of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV. Practically forming a personal union between France and Spain, the balance of power is seriously disturbed. Indeed, it is quite likely there is no going back. It looks like soon Europe will be in a state of war."
 mod.2.a:0 "A concerning development."
 mod.2.b:0 "Excellent!"
 mod.2.c:0 "Long live the king!"
 mod.3.t:0 "Escalation of the Great Northern War"
 mod.3.d:0 "After some inital clashes between Sweden, Denmark and Poland-Lithuania, the declaration of war by Russia has brought a dire situation upon Sweden. Outnumbered three to one, Sweden faces a struggle for survival unlike anything it has encountered before. While it is too early to predict what the outcome of the conflict might be, the Western European naval powers have expressed their concern, fearing the upheaval of the balance of power and a disruption in the Baltic trade."
 mod.4.t:0 "Denmark forced to surrender"
 mod.4.d:0 "In an impressive show of military force the Swedes have obliterated the Danish army and their resolve with it. It would appear that the anti-Swedish coalition has gravely underestimated the strength of the Swedish army. With the defeat of Denmark, Sweden can now fully focus on the eastern front."
 mod.5.t:0 "Renewal of the Treaty of The Hague"
 mod.5.d:0 "In response to the rising tensions with France, England, Austria and the Netherlands have renewed the 1689 alliance treaty. With this they hope to contain French agression, as a diplomatic outcome of the Spanish succession crisis seems to be off the table. "
 mod.5.a:0 "This can only lead to war..."
 mod.6.t:0 "The Grand Alliance attacks the Bourbon realm"
 mod.6.d:0 "A nightmare has become a reality. All diplomacy has failed between the Grand Alliance and France and her allies. The final insult was France's support for a pretender king in England. Once again, Europe descends into the horrors of war. " 
 mod.6.a:0 "May God have mercy on our souls!"
 mod.7.t:0 "Rákóczi's War of Independence"
 mod.7.d:0 "Following years of unrest in Hungary, the Hungarian nobleman Ferenc Rákóczi has raised arms against his Habsburg overlord. There had been unrest for quite some time in the region following the destructive Great Turkish war.\n\nThe harsh occupation by the Austrians caused many Hungarians to turn agains the Habsburg regime. Now, with the majority of the Austrian army far away from Hungary, Rákóczi took advantage of the situation. He supported by Louis XIV of France, but many of the Hungarian nobility have refused to back his cause, treating it as a mere jacquerie. The future of both Hungary and the Austrian empire remains uncertain, and only time can tell whether the Hungarian state will survive this ordeal."
 mod.8.t:0 "The Treaty of Karlowitz"
 mod.8.d:0 "On 26 January 1699, the Treaty of Karlowitz was signed after two months of negotiations between the Ottoman Empire and the Holy League, thus concluding the Great Turkish war of 1683-1697. The treaty saw large territorial losses for the Ottoman Empire; they lost most of Hungary to Austria, parts of Greece to Venice, as well as parts of Crimea and other losses. The Ottoman Empire now faces a period of instability, and it remains to be seen what the effects of this new balance of power will be."
 mod.8.a:0 "Once a great power, now the sick man of Europe..."
 mod.9.t:0 "Philip V crowned king of Spain"
 mod.9.d:0 "In an unexpected turn of events, it was announced it would not be Charles of Austria, but Philip of Anjou who will succeed Charles II as king of Spain. To avoid an unbalance and conflict and Europe. The Spanish regency has agreed in secret negotiations to transfer the Southern Netherlands and Italian lands to Austria. Diplomats all over Europe are hopeful that this alternative treaty might bring peace and stability to Europe."
 mod.9.a:0 "Quite unexpected, indeed."
 mod.9.b:0 "Excellent."
 mod.9.c:0 "Long live the king!"
 mod.10.t:0 "Charles III crowned king of Spain"
 mod.10.d:0 "Although the Treaty of London was not ratified by Austria, fearing French presence in Italy, the Spanish regency council has announced the ratification of the Treaty of London, partitioning the Spanish Empire between the Austrian archduke Charles and Louis XIV of France. Even though the partition is considered fair by the English government, it remains uncertain if the situation will ensure European peace."
 mod.10.a:0 "Let us hope for everlasting peace."
 mod.11.t:0 "Charles III crowned king of Spain"
 mod.11.d:0 "Disregarding the Treaty of London, it was announced that Charles of Austria will inherit the whole of the Spanish empire. The Spanish nobility was not fond of a partition of the Spanish realm. Hence while the integrity will be preserved. However, the French government has already announced it will contest the succession. Indeed, war seems inevitable."
 mod.11.a:0 "This leads to no good."
 mod.11.b:0 "We must react to this outrage!"
 mod.11.c:0 "Long live Von Habsburg!"
 mod.11.e:0 "Excellent news from Madrid."
 mod.12.t:0 "Prussia proclaims Kingdom"
 mod.12.d:0 "The former Prince-Elector of Brandenburg-Prussia, Frederick III,  has announced he shall henceforth be known as King in Prussia. Following the agreement of the Krontraktat between Prussia and Austria, the Austrian has allowed an exception on the rule that no prince in Germany has the right to call themselves king.\n \nThe title ‘King in Prussia’ reflects the legal fiction that Frederick is officially only sovereign over the Duchy of Prussia, whilst still being a mere elector within the border of the Holy Roman Empire. With the proclamation of a new kingdom in Europa, the balance of power might shift once more. The question remains however, in whose favour?"
 mod.12.b:0 "Long may Prussia live!"
 mod.12.a:0 "They are a bit full of themselves it seems..."

 mod.18.t:0 "Dutch Government Declares Bankruptcy"
 mod.18.d:0 "Following years of economic depression and excessive spending on the navy and military, the Dutch government was forced to announce the bankruptcy of the Dutch state. Their loans have been forgiven and the currency has been devaluated. In time, their economy will be able to start anew, but the immediate impact will be severe."
 mod.18.a:0 "An economic disaster!"
 mod.19.t:0 "Herald from Rome - Innocent XII has died"
 mod.19.d:0 "Some days ago, pope Inncocent has passed away at the blessed age of 85. The whole of the Catholic church is now in mourning. At the meantime, the college of cardinals will convene in the Vatican to appoint his successor. Insiders say the election of a new pope will not be without difficulty due to the tense situation in Europe."
 mod.20.t:0 "Consecration Pope Clement XI"
 mod.20.d:0 "Pope Clement XI has been consecrated in the Vatican. The new pope is young and energetic. He is considered a non-political pope, reinforcing the notion that the Papal States will remain neutral in the upcoming conflict in Europe. Instead, Clement is more focussed on administrative matters and is considered a lover of great art."
 mod.23.t:0 "Civil War in the Commonwealth!"
 mod.23.d:0 "Following rising tensions in the Commonwealth, a plot by the Szlachta has sprung into effect. Calling on their right of rokosz, a term used for a szlachta insurrection legally defined in the Golden liberties, they have raised arms against their former king, seeking to appoint a new monarch in his stead. The world now watches anxiously towards te conflict, as the outcome may have a tremendous impact on the rest of the world."
 mod.24.t:0 "Swedish Capture of Moscow"
 mod.24.d:0 "Following a fierce battle and a long march towards Moscow, the Swedish army has captured the city of Moscow whilst being personally commanded by their liege. To make matters worse, during the siege the Russian czar was captured by the Swedes. With his fate uncertain, the world watches in awe as Russia faces dark days."
 mod.25.t:0 "Forced Abdication of Peter I"
 mod.25.d:0 "Following his capture by Swedish troops, the Russian czar was left in a vulnerable position, allowing the Swedes to enforce any treaty they wanted upon Russia. Now that Peter was forced to abdicate and his line has been forced to renounce their claims on the Russian throne, the Russian nation faces chaos beyond imagination. Only time can tell what  the future brings for the whole of eastern Europe."
 mod.26.t:0 "The Siberian Republic Secedes"
 mod.26.d:0 "Following the Russian government's failure in dealing with the Bashkir Rebellion, the Bashkirs have declared themselves effectively independent from rule in Moscow and have cut all communications to Siberia as a result. Following this, the Russian Settlers in Siberia have declared their independence, and have claimed themselves the successor to the legendary "Baghdad of Siberia" or the "Golden Boiling City of Siberia", which is also known as 'Mangazeya'. Unfortunately, the native Siberian tribes have also asserted their local authority which leaves the future of the Siberian region uncertain."
 mod.27.t:0 "Second Time of Troubles"
 mod.27.d:0 "Following the disastrous defeat in the Great Northern War, combined with famine, plague and public unrest, the Russian state has completely collapsed. Various warlords have declared independence, whilst the Cossacks and nomadic tribes wreak havoc in the Southern and Eastern provinces of the empire. Caught in a terrible civil war, some statesmen see strong parallels with the Time of Troubles, dubbing Russia’s latest series of internal turmoil as the Second Time of Troubles."

 mod.33.t:0 "Resumption of the Great Turkish War"
 mod.33.d:0 "In an extremely surprising turn of events, the Ottomans diplomats stormed out of the negiotiations, and the Great Turkish War has henceforth resumed. With both sides being extremely tired of the decades of war, it remains to be seen who shall win. Although the Ottomans were decisively defeated at the Battle of Zenta which led to them immediately entering peace talks, the might of the Ottoman army cannot be denied. All of Europe holds it's breath as the ruinous war resumes. The fate of Eastern Europe hangs in the balance."
 mod.33.a:0 "Interesting."

 crisis.2.a:0 "Only war can solve this..."
 crisis.2.b:0 "This is politics!"
 crisis.3.t:0 "Drunken fight"
 crisis.3.d:0 "There tends to be an excess of wine and champagne during the negotiations. This sometimes leads to incidents with drunk diplomats, such as today, when our ambassador was attacked by an inebriated representative."
 crisis.3.a:0 "This cannot stand!"
 crisis.3.b:0 "He was just drunk..."
 crisis.4.t:0 "All diplomacy fails"
 crisis.4.d:0 "All of our diplomats are in agreement. Every attempt to solve the Spanish Crisis diplomatically has failed. Over the last weeks it had become especially clear that the French never even had the intention of finding a diplomatic solution. They hunger for war... But we shall stand united, and we shall crush this evil threat for the stability of Europe. Today, we go to war!"
