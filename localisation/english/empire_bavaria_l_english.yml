 bavaria.1.t:0 "Sudden Death of Joseph Ferdinand"
 bavaria.1.d:0 "Shocking news from Brussels! Our liege, Maximilian II Emanuel's son Joseph Ferdinand has passed away at the young age of six. Whilst it is assumed the boy died because of a fever, some believed he was poisoned. Originally Joseph Ferdinand was supposed to be heir to not only the Bavarian throne, but also the throne of Spain. As Spain remained without an heir whilst the condition of its king continued to worsen, a treaty in 1698 aimed to diffuse the bomb by making Joseph Ferdinand heir to the throne. Now that the boy has died, not only is Bavaria left without an heir, but also Spain. Whilst the Bavarian court grieves, the rest of Europe holds its breath for the ticking time bomb that is the Spanish succession crisis."
