Conflicts with the Native Americans and other European powers vying for control of the New World have been commonplace, and now it remains to be seen whether the English will be able to control their valuable colony, or whether the colonists will decide to govern themselves instead..."

 # Events
 usa.1.d:0 "After months of rising tensions between American patriots and British regulars, violence has finally broken out between the two opposing sides.\n\nThomas Gage, British Commander-In-Chief of North America since 1763 and appointed governor of Massachusetts since 1774, had received orders directly from the British government to take action against the patriots. Based on his intelligence, he had sent out a British force to destroy stores of militia ordnance at Concord by way of Lexington, and to capture John Hancock and Samuel Adams who were considered two principal instigators of the rebellion. The operation was to commence before midnight to suprise the militia whilst completing their objectives and retreating to Boston before mulitudes of militas could respond. However, patriot intelligence which was organised by Paul Revere, learned of Gage's plans and alerted captain John Parker, commander of the Concord militia. The first act of war was a brief skirmish at Lexington, followed by a full-scaled battle during the Battles of Lexington and Concord. After suffering some 300 casualties, British troops withdrew to Boston, followed by local milita which laid siege to the city.\n\nThese events mark the end of peaceful protest and rising tension, and the beginning of a full blown escalation. Soon, all of America will hear of this, and a full blown war with Britain will be inevitable. "
 usa.2.d:0 "After months of rising tension in the Thirteen Colonies, and especially the rebellious colony of Massachusetts, the patriot terrorists have taken up arms against us. As Commander-In-Chief Thomas Gage had sent out a force to confiscate a milita arsenal and arrest known traitors to the British crown, John Hancock and Samuel Adams, his army was viciously ambushed by patriot militas in Lexington. This later escalated to a full blown Battle of Lexington and Concord, where we have lost some 300 good soldiers. Parliament has taken note of this escalation of violence, and now urges king George to issue a formal declaration of war on these colonies and to restore order in these rebellious regions."
 usa.3.d:0 "On December 16th 1773, tensions between the American colonies and the British homeland had reached a new hight. For the past few decades, tensions and protests have been rising in the Thirteen Colonies in response to the taxation increases by Britain following the costly 7 Year's War which was fought mostly to protect the Thirteen Colonies. The Sons of Liberty, a political movement which seeks to advance the rights of colonists and to fight taxation by the British government, had organised a protest action on the 16th of Decemeber aimed at the so-called Tea Act which dramatically increased taxes on Tea. That evening, the sons of liberty, led by Samuel Adams, dressed like Mohawk warriors boarded a docked tea ship, and destroyed its cargo of Tea. Slogans such as 'No Taxation Without Representation' were heard on the scene. Whilst the action has inspired some anti-British sentiments throughout the Thirteen Colonies, it has also alarmed the British authorities who are expected to react in a harsh manner."
 usa.4.d:0 "The British Parliament has passed a new act, the Boston Port Act. This new act closes the port of Boston and demands full payment of the city's residents to pay for the damage done by the tea dumping party of December 16th. This act is part of a greater plan by king George III to intimidate Boston's increasingly unruly residents. The Boston Port act is the first of four drafted proposals collectively knowns as the coercive acts."
 usa.5.d:0 "Parliament has once again passed a law targetting the repression of the colony of Massachusetts. The new act has revoked the colony's original charter of 1691, and has instead been replaced by direct British control through a royally-appointed governor with wide-ranging powers. The colonists in Massachusetts have already announced that this act goes against the very core principles of Massachusetts and they will fervently oppose this new form of government."
 usa.6.d:0 "In yet another vile attempt to repress the fair people of the Thirteen Colonies, the British parliament has passed the Act for the Impartial Administration of Justice. This act allows the royally appointed governor to remove any acquisition placed on a royal official by a patriot, if the governor did not believe the official would have a fair trial. The act has quickly gained the nickname as the 'Murder Act', because many patriots blieve that the officials in question could even get away with capital offenses.\n\nTo assure trials more conducive to the Crown than the prejudices of local juries, the Act has granted a change of venue to another British colony or Great Britain in trials of officials charged with a crime growing out of their enforcement of the law or suppression of riots. Witnesses for both sides are also required to attend the trial and are to be compensated for their expenses.\n\nEven though the new act is not all bad, it will most likely be remembered by the nicknames the patriots have given to it."
 usa.7.d:0 "Parliament has passed another Quartering Act in a similar fashion to the one of 1765. The act seeks to create a more effective method of housing British troops in America. In a previous act, the colonies had been required to provide housing for soldiers, but colonial legislatures had been uncooperative in doing so. The new Quartering Act allows a governor to house soldiers in other buildings if suitable quarters were not provided. The worst part of the bill, is that the American colonies are required to pay for the upkeep of the quartered troops, angering many."
 usa.8.d:0 "In a proposterous turn of events, our ungrateful subjects in the Thirteen Colonies have declared their independence. This is completely unheard of, as these subjects have long been granted great autonomy. Whilst the insurrection is at the very least surprising, the military is not too concerned about our prospects of restoring order in the colonies. The colonies only a few hundred thousand inhabitants, making it effectively impossible to field an army that could withstand our overwhelming force. Upon receiving the news, parliament has effectively immediatly authorised the invasion of the colonies, but the final declaration of war is in the hands of the monarch."
 usa.9.d:0 "Now that we have acquired Nova Scotia, the board of trade of North America has requested we hand over the territory under their administration for the optimal governance of the region. They will remain subject to the crown, but it will be indirectly controlled if we agree to this request."
 usa.10.d:0 "[ENG.GetName] has transferred the territory of Nova Scotia to us. From now on we shall be responsible for the governance and defense of the region."
 usa.11.d:0 "Although we had initially requested the transfer of Nova Scotia, [ENG.GetName] has decided it is best if they remain in control of the land for now to ensure optimal control over the region. While we would beg to differ, we can not go against the wishes of the crown."
 usa.12.d:0 "Now that we have acquired Newfoundland, the board of trade of North America has requested we hand over the territory under their administration for the optimal governance of the region. They will remain subject to the crown, but it will be indirectly controlled if we agree to this request."
 usa.13.d:0 "[ENG.GetName] has transferred the territory of Newfoundland to us. From now on we shall be responsible for the governance and defense of the region."
 usa.14.d:0 "Although we had initially requested the transfer of Newfoundland, [ENG.GetName] has decided it is best if they remain in control of the land for now to ensure optimal control over the region. While we would beg to differ, we can not go against the wishes of the crown."

Now [FROM.GetName] has recognized our independence, which helps us ever so slightly towards achieving universal recognition. From a practical standpoint, the establishment of diplomatic relations has opened the possibility of engaging in trade with the country."
