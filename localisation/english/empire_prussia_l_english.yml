prussia.4.t:0 "[From.GetName] demands Western Prussia"
prussia.4.d:0 "[From.GetName] has demanded that we cede the territories of Mazury, Poznan and Danzig. They claim the territories as rightfully theirs and threaten that if we do not hand over the territories peacefully, they will take them by force."
prussia.4.a:0 "Give up the territories."
prussia.4.b:0 "They are bluffing!"
prussia.5.t:0 "Poland-Lithuania yields!"
prussia.5.d:0 "The king of Poland-Lithuania has followed common sense and has handed over our long-lost regions. Now it is time to celebrate the return of our brethren to the realm."
prussia.5.a:0 "The Prussian eagle will rise!"
prussia.6.t:0 "Poland-Lithuania refuses!"
prussia.6.d:0 "The king of Poland-Lithuania has refused handing over our territories, thinking we are merely bluffing. Clearly they underestimate the strength of juggernaut that is our nation."
prussia.6.a:0 "They know what the alternative is."
prussia.7.t:0 "[From.GetName] proposes a federation"
prussia.7.d:0 "[From.GetName] has proposed we merge our two orders in one grand state of those devoted to God. Seeing our relative size, it might be a wise idea to merge into a greater cause, even if that means that our state must seize to exist."
prussia.7.a:0 "We accept, for the greater cause."
prussia.7.b:0 "What a preposterous notion!"
prussia.8.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts!"
prussia.8.d:0 "The knights of Saint-John have wisely accepted our proposal to merge our two orders into a formidable fighting force. Soon, all the heathens in the world will tremble at the might of our unified order!"
prussia.8.a:0 "A wise decision."
prussia.9.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses!"
prussia.9.d:0 "The Knights of Saint-John have refused our proposal to merge our order. Now the question arises whether the cause of the Knights is as just as they themselves claim. Their lack of a long-term vision will likely impact the future of the monastic state."
prussia.9.a:0 "No hard feelings"
prussia.9.b:0 "We should convince them by force!"
prussia.10.t:0 "Prussia presses personal union"
prussia.10.d:0 "The representatives of Prussia have approached us, calling for the creation of a personal union for the mutual benefit of our nations."
prussia.10.a:0 "Let our thrones unite!"
prussia.10.b:0 "NUTS"
prussia.11.t:0 "Ansbach accepts Union!"
prussia.11.d:0 "The Principality of Ansbach has been sold to us and using our claim to the throne through its previous leader being apart of the junior branch of the Hohenzollern Dynasty, we have gained foot on the southern regions of the Holy Roman Empire."
prussia.11.a:0 "Insignificant but welcoming!"
prussia.12.t:0 "Ansbach prefers independence"
prussia.12.d:0 "Very unexpected and unsurprising, the Principality of Ausbach is not willing to join us despite our claim to the throne and the previous ruler unwilling to rule and putting it up to sale."
prussia.12.a:0 "Oh well..."
prussia.12.b:0 "This is unacceptable!"
prussia.13.t:0 "[From.GetName] proposes a federation"
prussia.13.d:0 "[From.GetLeader] of [From.GetName] has addressed a letter to [Root.GetLeader] proposing a far-reaching federation between our two great states. Considering the overwhelming might of Prussia, we might not be able to refuse this offer. As they have previously shown, their words are often backed by a powerful military force."
prussia.13.a:0 "Federating is the best for our people."
prussia.13.b:0 "But we too, have a capable military!"
prussia.14.t:0 "[From.GetName] accepts federation"
prussia.14.d:0 "The prince of [From.GetName], [From.GetLeader], has accepted our offer to join our two states into a confederation. A glorious day for our new rising empire."
prussia.14.a:0 "[Root.GetName] is a state stronger."
prussia.15.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses federation"
prussia.15.d:0 "The cowardly prince [From.GetName] of [From.GetName] has refused to join us in our project to unite the German sphere. Supposedly, they have sympathies for the French seeking to destabilize the realm of the Germans. "
prussia.15.a:0 "Too bad, for them."
prussia.16.t:0 "Prussia demands Ostfrieland"
prussia.16.d:0 "The Kingdom of Prussia has sent us an ultimatum demanding we return the state of Ostfrieland to them, immediately, or face dire consequences. What do we do?"
prussia.16.a:0 "We have no choice. We must give up our land."
prussia.16.b:0 "Never! Ostfrieland is rightfully Dutch, and we will be keeping it."
prussia.17.t:0 "The Netherlands Refuse"
prussia.17.d:0 "The Kingdom of the Netherlands has refused our ultimatum, the filthy rats. What do we do?"
prussia.17.a:0 "This means war. We will take Emden back, by any means necessary."
prussia.17.b:0 "We cannot risk a war with the Dutch. Let us retreat for now."
mod.34.t:0 "Prussia proclaims Catholic Kingdom"
mod.34.d:0 "Surprinsingly, Prussia had declared itself a Catholic kingdom despite the majority of it's population being Protestant. Apparently, Prussia had gotten support from the Pope himself to proclaim itself a Catholic nation and has actively began converting it's population to Catholicism, as well as following starting the process of reuniting the Teutonic Order. This has led to an increased aggression towards its neighbours, and only time will tell what becomes of the new Teutonic Order."
mod.34.a:0 "Concerning."
mod.34.b:0 "Deus Vult!"
ultimatum.0.t:0 "Prussia Demands Schleswig"
ultimatum.0.d:0 "Prussia seeks to unite all German lands under their rule. Their next target is our county of Schleswig-Holstein. They sent us an ultimatum to hand it over to their control. If we refuse, they will try to take it by force."

ultimatum.0.b:0 "If it is war they seek, they will get war"
ultimatum.1.t:0 "Prussia Demands control over Saxony"
ultimatum.1.d:0 "Frederick of Prussia claims that he would be a better leader for our nation. Our current leader, August, spends most of his time in Poland where he was elected king. This man even converted to Catholicism. Frederick says that it's time for proper German and Protestant rule. Accepting this will end our autonomy and make us a formal part of the kingdom of Prussia. Refusing will probably mean war."
ultimatum.1.a:0 "We welcome our fellow German liberator!"
ultimatum.1.b:0 "Stay Loyal to our Prince!"
ultimatum.2.t:0 "Prussia demands control over our German lands"
ultimatum.2.d:0 "As we are at war with all the Northern major powers, Prussia is trying to get involved. They will enter the war on our enemy’s side unless we cede control of our German lands to them. We must seriously consider this offer, for we are already in a tenuous situation."
ultimatum.21.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses our Demands"
ultimatum.21.d:0 "Despite their sticky situation, Sweden has stood firm and has refused to transfer the German lands to us. We now stand before a choice, we can either press our claims, or let it go."
ultimatum.2.a:0 "We cannot afford fighting another major nation."
ultimatum.2.b:0 "Our German lands are too precious to us; we will protect it at all costs!"
ultimatum.3.t:0 "Prussia asks for control over our German lands"
ultimatum.3.d:0 "They entered the war on our side which switched the odds in our favour. Now they ask payment in the form of land. Our German lands of Bremen and Pomerania have a long time been on their mind. It would be a perfect payment."
ultimatum.3.a:0 "Give them what they want, their help was very important."
ultimatum.3.b:0 "Only give Pomerania, their help was not that important."
ultimatum.3.c:0 "Don't give anything, they did nothing of importance in this war."

ultimatum.4.t:0 "Prussia asks us to give them Saxony."
ultimatum.4.d:0 "After successfully changing the odds in our favour in the war against Sweden, Prussia now demands compensation. They propose this compensation in the form of land, namely the Duchy of Prussia. The Prussians claim that because of our primary focus in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Saxon territories would be better off under the control of the Prussian prince-elector. Agreeing to transfer these lands, will surely solidify our relations for decades to come."
ultimatum.4.a:0 "These demands are reasonable."
ultimatum.4.b:0 "Outrageous demands! We are perfectly able to control Saxony ourselves."
ultimatum.41.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses!"
ultimatum.41.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has refused our demands, even though it was but a fair ask. They have proven what kind of friends they are, and we should rethink our foreign policy in the future..."
ultimatum.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Accepts!"
ultimatum.5.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our demands. Our realm has greatly expanded, a glorious day for Prussia!"
