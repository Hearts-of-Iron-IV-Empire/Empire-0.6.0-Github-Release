 DEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark-Norway is a shell of its former self. Following disastrous campaigns against Sweden in de 17th century, they lost large parts of their country, especially the important county of Skåne. With a sputtering economy, and a small army, the large coalition forming against Sweden might be their last shot at reclaiming their old territories. Otherwise they might have to let them go, forever."
 SHL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Holstein-Gottorp is a small imperial prince, which has long been under the influence of the Scandinavian states. Now under the influence of Sweden, they are threatened to be pulled into a conflict in which they have little interest."

 # Leaders:

 FREDERICK_IV_DESC:0 "Frederick IV succeeded his father Christian V in 1699. As crown prince, Frederick broadened his education by travelling in Europe, led by his chamberlain Ditlev Wibe. He was particularly impressed by the architecture in Italy and, on his return to Denmark, asked his father, Christian V, for permission to build a summer palace on Solbjerg. As a young and new king, his path is not yet set in stone, and only time will tell what impact he will have on the future of Denmark-Norway."
 SOPHIA_HEDWIG_DESC:0 "Queen Sophia Hedwig of Denmark and Norway, previously known as princess Sophia Hedwig, succeeded her brother after he died without issue.\n\nSophia Hedwig became the object of marriage prospects early on and was betrothed three times. As a child, she became engaged to her cousin, John George IV, Elector of Saxony. This was in line with the traditional policy of dynastic marriage between Denmark and Saxony which had at that point become a tradition. In 1689, it was decided that the marriage was to take place two years later. When John George succeeded his father in 1691, he broke the engagement. In 1692, a marriage to the future Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor, was suggested, and from 1694 to 1697. However, Sophia Hedwig refused to convert to Catholicism despite considerable pressure to do so by her father.\n\n A recent policy since 1697 to attempt to mend ties between Sweden and Denmark-Norway, led to her marriage to Charles XII of Sweden, effectively making her queen-consort of Sweden. Although her marriage with king Charles XII is a happy one, one cannot help but be suspicious about the circumstances in which her elder brother died."
 CHRISTIAN_V_DESC:0 "Christian V of house Oldenburg is king of Denmark and Norway since 1670. Well-regarded by the common people, he was the first king anointed at Frederiksborg Castle chapel as absolute monarch since the decree that institutionalized the supremacy of the king in Denmark-Norway. Christian fortified the absolutist system against the aristocracy by accelerating his father's practice of allowing both Holstein nobles and Danish and Norwegian commoners into state service.\n\nAs king, Christian has always wanted to show his power as absolute monarch through architecture and has long dreamed of Danish Versailles. He was the first to use the 1671 Throne Chair of Denmark, partly made for this purpose. His motto is: Pietate et Justitia (With piety and justice)."

denmark.4.t:0 "Parliament presses for Intervention in Scandinavia"
denmark.4.d:0 "As war has broken out between the Northern powers Denmark and Sweden, parliament has stated the absolute urgency to intervene against the Danish agression in order to maintain the stability in the Baltic. As tensions are rising in Western Europe, so are the grain prices, causing the risk of famine. It is almost certain that the war between Denmark and Sweden will cause grain supply from the Baltic to virtually dry up. What's even more important is the control of the Sound tolls. Should either Sweden or Denmark gain control over either side of the Sound straits, it will drastically impact our trading potential in the region, hence why the status quo must be maintained. Parliament is fairly positive that Denmark will back down if confronted by the might by the combined Anglo-Dutch military and naval strength. Should we not intervene, then the balance of power is at stake."

Whilst it is not certain whether or not they would go through with their plans of military intervention, we should be extremely cautious as they, along with their personal union partner of the Netherlands, hold a vastly superior military and navy."

denmark.12.d:0 "Denmark has promised us aid in our wars to come, if we agree to return their old core state of Scania. The state has been plagued by rebellion for decades now and seeing how we might have to face a greater foe soon, signing this pact might not be the worst cause of action.
