 # Events:
sweden.0.t:0 "Sweden Anno 1699"
sweden.0.d:0 "As Sweden prepares to enter the 18th century it finds itself in a perilous state. After its military successes in the 30 years' war (1618-1648) Sweden had risen as a new great power in Europe, securing holdings in Northern Germany and defeating imperial forces with its far superior Gustavian infantry. \n\n Sweden's rise to power made them a few enemies, most notably the powerful Russian state rising in the East. Seeing our state as weak and ruled by a young and incompetent monarch, there is a fear that Russia will seek to exploit Sweden's moment of weakness and take its place as a European great power."
sweden.1.t:0 "Opening up peace talks with Sweden"
sweden.1.d:0 "As our forces close in on the Swedish heartland after a hard fought battle their situation appears more dire and irreversable. However, Sweden is not willing to accept an unconditional surrender by any means just yet. Many of our advisors believe continuing the war will only further destabilize our nation and add to our war exhaustion. Our diplomats estimate it is quite realistic to demand the Baltic, the Neva area and some border regions along Finland, whilst others have more bold visions such as subjecting all of Finland, or even push for a complete surrender and a march to Stockholm. The final decision is in your hands, what deal should we propose the deal? Should the Swedes not accept our demands of surrender, we will be able to re-open negotiations in a few months."

sweden.2.t:0 "Peace offer from Russia"
sweden.2.d:0 "We have received a peace offer from Russia, demanding that we cede minor territories on the Russian border and Estonia. Seeing our precarious position it might not be a bad idea to come to the negotioating table."
sweden.2.a:0 "We must accept this deal."
sweden.2.b:0 "We will never surrender!"
sweden.3.t:0 "Peace offer from Russia"
sweden.3.d:0 "We have received a peace offer from Russia, demanding that we cede minor territories on the Russian border, Estonia and all of Finland. Whilst these demands are proposterous they might be the only chance we will get to get out of this alive."
sweden.3.a:0 "We are offered no other option."
sweden.3.b:0 "No, these demands cannot be met! We will fight them back."
sweden.4.t:0 "Sweden accepts our peace offer"

sweden.4.a:0 "Excellent"
sweden.5.t:0 "Sweden refuses our peace offer"

sweden.5.a:0 "They have chosen death."
sweden.6.t:0 "Sweden offers Scania for an alliance"
sweden.6.d:0 "Alarmed by the growing presence of both Danish and Russian forces on the Swedish border, Sweden has decided to resort to diplomacy instead of seeking confrontation. They have approached us with a deal, stateing that if we do unite against Russia, Russia will eventually conquer all of Scandinavia. As part of the deal, they have offered our lost core province of Scania as a sign of goodwill."
sweden.6.a:0 "It is a good deal, let us unite against Russia!"
sweden.6.b:0 "Why make deals if we can have it all?"
sweden.7.t:0 "Denmark accepts"
sweden.7.d:0 "Denmark has accepted our proposal. The province of Scania has been transferred, and Denmark and Sweden are now officialy in an alliance. Whilst we have temprorily lost our territory, expansion toward the east will soon enrichen our nation!"
sweden.7.a:0 "Northern Brothers Unite!"
sweden.8.t:0 "Denmark refuses"
sweden.8.d:0 "The Danes have stupidly refused our deal, reinforcing what we already thought, that they and the Russians are plotting against us. But is their loss, if they will not do diplomacy, then they will be defeated in battle instead."
sweden.8.a:0 "Fools."
sweden.9.t:0 "Propose a Royal Marriage"
sweden.9.d:0 "As we seek to strenghten our ties with the Danish throne, a royal marriage between our nations is considered a great idea. Securing a royal marriage might also lead to a closer union with Denmark. King Charles has laid his eyes on the beautiful Sophia Hedwig, one of the daughters of Christian V, and sister of his successor. However, Denmark must obviously approve for such a marriage to take place."
sweden.9.a:0 "Put up a diplomatic effort"

sweden.12.t:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] refuses royal marriage"
sweden.12.d:0 "[FROM.GetLeader] has reluctantly refused our offer, claiming it is not the right time to arrange a wedding. He also claims that Sophia herself was not interested, and was heard complaining at the prospect."
sweden.12.a:0 "It was not meant to be."
denmark.2.t:0 "Death of Frederick IV"
denmark.2.d:0 "King Frederick IV has decided to die a little too soon, albeit in suspicious circumstances. As Frederick had not yet fathered a child of his own, the throne will pass on to his sister Sophia Hedwig, whose husband Charles XII of Sweden will hence rule in her name over Sweden, Denmark and Norway."
denmark.2.a:0 "At least we get to keep our independence, right?"
denmark.2.b:0 "A lucky coincidence."
sweden.13.t:0 "The Fate of Russia"
sweden.13.d:0 "With the capture of Moscow, a Russian comeback seems more and more unlikely. At this point in fact, the Russians will accept nearly any treaty we force down their throats. Many options lie on the table, but which one will you choose?"
sweden.14.t:0 "The dethroning of Peter I"
sweden.14.d:0 "Following the capture of Moscow and the capture of our czar Peter I, Sweden has enforced a grave treaty upon us, virtually dooming our nation. Among demands, the Czar was forced to abdicate and renounce any claims of the Romanov dynasty, leaving our nation without a proper ruler. Following the receival of this news, the military has temporarily seized control over the nation, seeking to stabilize it and attempting to avert internal strife, although many speculate at this point civil war is inevitable. As Swedish troops pull out of Russia, the future of our state is uncertain…"
sweden.15.t:0 "Collapse of central authority"
sweden.15.d:0 "After the futile attempts by the military to stabilize the country, many have now rejected the military junta’s authority, plunging our nation into complete anarchy and disaster! As many factions seek to fill in the power vacuum left behind by the Swedes, a civil war is all but inevitable. One could well and truly say, we have entered a Second Time of Troubles!"
sweden.16.t:0 "The Bashkirs Rebel!"
sweden.16.d:0 "The Bashkirs have constantly been agitated by our decision to seize military equipment in support of the war against Sweden. Unfortunately, Tsar Peter has been deposed by the Swedes with the Fall of Moscow... the Bashkirs surely know their treasonous acts against the all-mighty Russian Tsardom!"
sweden.18.t:0 "The Cossacks Secede on the Steppes"
sweden.18.d:0 "Following the beginning of the Second Times of Troubles, the Cossacks in the Steppes have declared full neutrality and sovereignity from the disastrous conflict in Muscovy alongside the Kalmyks who have aligned themselves with the Cossacks. The Zaporozhian Cossacks have also seized Sloboda Ukrainia by garnering support from the Local Military in the region. Despite the critical value of the Volga Region, we have bigger fish to fry and we are simply unable to fight a two-fronted war especially against the superior Cossacks Warriors who dominate the Steppes..."
sweden.19.t:0 "Siberia Secedes"
sweden.19.d:0 "TODO"
sweden.20.d:0 "As the reign of chaos continues, tartar minorities have seized this ‘opportunity’ to further destabilize the nation, declaring the rebirth of the sultanate of Qasim. Thankfully, the insurrection is limited to area around Tambov, but a fear exists that their insurrection might spread quickly if not quelled instantly."
sweden.21.t:0 "The Cossacks Revolt!"
sweden.21.d:0 "One of the last threats we could have feared, has now also became a bitter reality. The barbarous scum and villainy in the South of our country, otherwise known as the Cossacks, have seen their chance to create their own states of filth and anarchy. They will have to be crushed decisively, if we are to protect the values of our nation."
sweden.22.t:0 "Warlord seize Ryazan and Yaroslavl!"
sweden.22.d:0 "With our forces spread thin, minor warlords in the heart of our nation have seized control over their local dukedoms. Whilst they have small military force, they directly threaten the capital, and might thus easily gain control over the heart of our nation."
sweden.23.t:0 "Russia wants unconditional surrender."
sweden.23.d:0 "Russia has proclaimed it would rather not negotioate with our nation, saying they would much rather wipe our nation from the map forever. By continueing resistance at the highest level, we have nothing to lose and everything to gain."
sweden.24.t:0 "Sweden open for Negotiations"
sweden.24.d:0 "Seeing the war effort turn against them, Sweden has come to terms with their defeat and has extended an invitation for peace talks by one of their ambassadors. We may chose to open negotiations add any point we desire."
sweden.25.t:0 "The Fate of Poland-Lithuania"
sweden.25.d:0 "Following a quick and unexpected victory our troops have managed to capture Warsaw and bring Poland to its knees. Now the question lingers, how we will continue the governance from this point onward. Various options are on the table, and it is up to his majesty to decide how to move forward."
sweden.26.t:0 "The Fate of Poland-Lithuania"
sweden.26.d:0 "Following our successful invasion into the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth has agreed to enter into a vassal relation with us. However, some questions remain on the exact organisation of this, and there are of course concerns about the loyalty of the Commonwealth, calling into question the installation of a more pro-Swedish king."
sweden.27.t:0 "Swedish Dominance in the Baltic"
sweden.27.d:0 "Following the recent developments in the war between Denmark and Sweden, it seems Sweden has seized complete control over the Scandinavian pennisula, gravely upsetting the balance of power in the region and harming our intersts. Tories and Whigs alike agree that this situation is completely unacceptable and intervention is necessary."
sweden.28.t:0 "England protests our expansion!"
sweden.28.d:0 "Word from England. They have protested our expansion into Denmark, citing it as an upset to the balance of power in the Northern regions. Obviously, they care little for the politics for our region, and they merely see their trade intrests threatened. They demand we retreat from Denmark-Norway, claiming they will otherwise take action against us."
sweden.29.t:0 "Sweden retreats out of Denmark-Norway."
sweden.29.d:0 "After some negotations our extraordinary ambassador has returned to London with the news that Sweden has caved in to our demands and have pulled out of Denmark-Norway, once again restoring it to a sovereign kingdom. They have however held on to some regions they consider 'core territories' of the Swedish empire, but our ambassadors have deemed this to be acceptable. In order to prevent further disputed between the two nations, we will henceforth protect the kingdom of Denmark-Norway in order to ensure stability in the region. They agree to pull out of Denmark-Norway, as long as they be given the Sound toll rights."
sweden.30.t:0 "Sweden demands Sound toll rights"
sweden.30.d:0 "Demanding at least some form of spoils of war, the Swedes have demanded they be given the exclusive rights to the Sound toll previously held by Denmark. Whilst this may seem like a small demand, it is one of the most important political issues in the Baltic."
sweden.31.t:0 "England accepts middle ground."
sweden.31.d:0 "England has agreed to our small demands, ensuring peace between our two nations. It has to be said though, that many are unhappy with the arrangement, but it is widely accepted that we cannot afford a war with England."
sweden.32.t:0 "England stands firm"
sweden.32.d:0 "England has made it clear it demands us to fully retreat from Denmark-Norway and will settle for nothing less. They have given us one more chance to settle this issue through diplomacy."
sweden.33.t:0 "Sweden demands to keep Norway"
sweden.33.d:0 "Sweden has acknowledged they understand our grievances towards the fact that they hold all of Denmark-Norway, and have proposed a deal where they meet us in the middle. They will pull out of Denmark, but they want to hold on to the relatively poor kingdom of Norway. It is relatively agreed upon that the acquisition would have little consequence, but it will undoubtely have consequences in the future, dividing our diplomats on how to react to this proposal."
sweden.34.t:0 "England recognizes ownership of Norway!"
sweden.34.d:0 "We have managed to strike a deal with the English, where they will allow us to keep control over Norway, whilst we have a agreed to pull out of Denmark. They have also allowed us to keep the small colonial empire of Denmark in India. Most would agree, it is a good day to be a Swede!"
sweden.35.t:0 "Sweden dares us!"
sweden.35.d:0 "Sweden has dismissed our attempts to salvage the situation in Scandinavia, saying that we have no business in their affairs. Clearly, they do not believe in our persistance, that we will go to war if necessary. A motion will be brought to the floor of parliament on what our next move will be."
sweden.36.t:0 "England Embargoes us"
sweden.36.d:0 "Terrible news! The poor-in-resources nation of England, has decided to embargo us, the number one exporter of the finest steel in all of Europe, and the gateway into the Batlic sea and its grain trade. HOW WILL WE EVER RECOVER FROM THIS DEVASTATING BLOW???"
sweden.37.t:0 "England backs down."
sweden.37.d:0 "After months of though talking, the English have finally decided to back down. It seems like they had little appatite to enforce their ludicrous demands!"
sweden.38.t:0 "England intervenes in Scandinavia"
sweden.38.d:0 "Seeing the recent developments in the war between Denmark and Sweden, the English find the dominance of the Swedish empire to be upsetting and have demanded the Swedes to come to the table for negotiations on the future of the Scandinavian penninsula. England has expressed a particular interest in the region due to its importance of the grain trade, and many other sovereigns would agree that the dominance of Sweden in the region is a problematic feat that needs to be adressed. The English have approached Sweden diplomatically, but their firm language makes it seem like they do not exclude the possibility of war."
sweden.39.t:0 "The Treaty of Copenhagen"
sweden.39.d:0 "Following short negotiations between Sweden and England a compromise was reached concerning the future of Scandinavia. It was agreed upon that Sweden could not annex Denmark in its entirety, but for certain is that the former Swedish rival has been reduced to a shell of its former self. In conclusion, the balance of power has shifted in Scandinavia, but a new war has been prevented, at least for now."
sweden.40.d:0 "Our ally Poland-Lithuania, having stood dutifully by our side in the war against the Russian menace, have now requested their old eastern lands back as compensation for their war effort. Seeing how we have no reason to deny them this more than righteous demand, we should hand over the Russian occupied areas immediatly."
sweden.41.d:0 "Glorious news! Our ally Sweden has handed us back control over the Eastern territories, which were long lost to Russia. Thanks to the total defeat of Russia, Sweden has been able to execute these severe demands. Glory to Sweden, and glory to us!"
sweden.42.d:0 "Terrible news! Our king, Charles XII has been slain in battle, being fatally struck by a Danish projectile. The war has now definively turned against our favor. Charles will be succeeded by his sister Ultrika Eleonara, as he has not yet left an heir to the throne."
sweden.43.d:0 "Shocking news! Charles XII, the young king of Sweden, has perished in. In 1718 he had initiated yet another invasion into Norway with a force of 40.000 men, laying siege to the fortress of Frederiksten overlooking the town of Frederikshald. While in the trenches close to the perimeter of the fortress, Charles was struck in the head by a projectile, likely from a grapeshot, ad killed. Sweden is in crisis, as it has lost its king in a time of crisis when it needed its king the most."
sweden.44.d:0 "Welcome to the final phase of the Great Northern War. This is challenging scenario where you will have the last chance to turn around the war in Sweden's favor. Beware though, your enemies severly outnumber you and already have captured numerous victory points. Whats more, whilst above 50% surrender progress, Russia will demand your surrender every two months, which will tank your stability and war support. The victory conditions are total victory, meaning you capture Moscow, and capitulate Poland, Denmark and Prussia. Good Luck!"
