 IRO_proclamation_line_desc:0 "The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was issued by King George III on 7 October 1763. It followed the Treaty of Paris (1763), which formally ended the Seven Years' War and transferred French territory in North America to Great Britain. The Proclamation forbids all settlements west of a line drawn along the Appalachian Mountains, which has been delineated as an Indian Reserve. This has avoided conflict between the natives and the American settlers, although it has created tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies."
